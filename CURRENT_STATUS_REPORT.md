## üîç TECHNICAL ANALYSIS

### SimpleFIX Application Investigation

**Current Error Pattern:**
```
ERROR: Failed to establish connections
```

**Analysis:**
- **Different from previous:** No more encoding/parsing errors
- **New issue type:** Connection establishment failure
- **Possible causes:** Configuration mismatch, credential issues, or network problems
- **Investigation needed:** Compare with working production application

**Comparison with Working Apps:**
- **Production app:** Uses `icmarkets_robust_application.py` - WORKS
- **SimpleFIX app:** Uses `icmarkets_simplefix_application.py` - FAILS
- **Core API:** Direct FIX calls - WORKS

**Hypothesis:** SimpleFIX application may have configuration or implementation differences from the working robust application.

### Test Script Issues

**Current Import Failures:**
- `src.operational.icmarkets_config` - Module path issues
- `src.governance.system_config` - Missing governance modules

**Analysis:**
- **Some progress:** Fewer scripts failing than before
- **Remaining issues:** Import path inconsistencies
- **Impact:** Limited - core functionality unaffected
