# EMP Final Roadmap - Apex Predator Edition

This is the integrated master roadmap for the Evolving Market Predator (EMP). It unifies perception, belief, memory, causality, reflexivity, and safety into one cohesive architecture. The objective: **flawless market shadowing**â€”EMP must mirror every price dynamic, anticipate every regime, and never commit an avoidable error.

---

## I. Perception - Seeing All

- [x] **FIX + Multivenue Depth**: Parse and merge full-depth (L1-L20) order books from all connected exchanges to construct a unified liquidity map.
- [x] **Hidden Flow Detection**: Infer iceberg orders, block trades, and dark pool flow from quote flicker and fill anomalies.
- [x] **Cross-Market Correlation Sensor**: Continuously estimate lag/lead relationships between correlated assets and venues.
- [x] **Macro + Fundamental Ingest**: CPI, NFP, FOMC, earnings, ETF rebalances, dividend eventsâ€”all parsed, timestamped, and causally linked.
- [x] **Options Surface Monitor**: Track IV skew, OI walls, gamma exposure, delta imbalance.
- [ ] **Sentiment & Behavior Feed**: Integrate NLP tagging from financial news, social chatter, and filings.
- [x] **Volatility Topology Mapping**: Construct real-time volatility surfaces and flow aggression metrics.
- [x] **Adaptive Sampling**: Adjust sensor frequency to volatility state; always high resolution in chaos.

## II. Cognition - Knowing What Is True

- [x] **Causal Graph Engine**: Formal DAG linking macro → liquidity → microprice → fills. Enables intervention testing.
- [x] **Counterfactual Simulator**: Simulate outcomes under altered causes (do-calculus) to test belief robustness.
- [ ] **Mechanism Verification Tests**: Each feature must ship with a falsifiable economic hypothesis and a CI test.
- [ ] **Uncertainty-Aware Inference**: All predictions carry intervals and confidence; actions gated by lower-bound return.
- [ ] **Out-of-Distribution Sentry**: Detect when live data diverges from training; reduce aggressiveness accordingly.

---

## III. Reflexivity - Knowing Its Own Shadow

- [ ] **Self-Impact Model**: Quantify how EMP's trades alter the local order book and volatility.
- [ ] **Adversary Simulation**: Train exploit agents to mimic others observing EMP's pattern; guard against being anticipated.
- [x] **Entropy Governor**: Rotate tactics and randomize microtiming to stay unpredictable.
- [ ] **Infrastructure Awareness**: Integrate latency, queue position, and execution certainty into planner logic.

---

## IV. Belief & Memory - Never Forgetting, Always Contextualizing

- [x] **Belief Packets**: Each decision records context (features, regime, reasoning, confidence).
- [x] **Memory Index**: Store latent summaries of extreme episodes (e.g., flash crash, news shock) in FAISS.
- [ ] **Context Recall**: At runtime, weigh actions by similarity to stored experiences.
- [x] **Memory Gating**: Beliefs reinforced by memory are trusted; those without precedent trade lighter.
- [ ] **Decay Protocol**: Prune stale memories, reinforce recurring successful ones.

---

## V. Planner & Foresight - Acting Only When the Future Aligns

- [x] **MuZero-Lite Tree**: Simulate short-horizon futures with causal edge adjustments.
- [ ] **Veto Logic**: No action executes without positive expected return under ensemble belief.
- [x] **Latency-Aware Planning**: Discard planner branch if total decision latency > 0.85ms.
- [x] **Adversarial Simulation**: Inject spoofers, front-runners, and reversion agents into planner rollouts.

---

## VI. Evolution - Learning Through Battle

- [x] **League Evolution Engine**: Run evolutionary cycles with champions, exploiters, and chaos agents.
- [ ] **Mutation Ledger**: Record all parameter mutations, fitness improvements, and exploitability results.
- [ ] **Surrogate Simulation**: Fast proxy model (GraphNet) for testing policy evolution.
- [x] **Curriculum Scheduler**: Inject rare or catastrophic events into training more frequently.
- [x] **Auto-Demotion**: Any live policy failing drift or exploitability gates is rolled back automatically.

---

## VII. Metacognition - Awareness of Its Own Limits

- [x] **Belief Competence Matrix**: Maintain per-regime confidence in each belief family.
- [x] **Persistent Red-Team Agents**: Dedicated adversaries specialize in EMP's known weak spots.
- [x] **Self-Audit Reports**: Daily introspection logs outlining what it knows, what it doubts, and what changed.
- [ ] **Auto-RFC Generator**: When gates fail, open automatic patch proposals suggesting remediation.

---

## VIII. Risk Doctrine - No Avoidably Bad Trades

- [ ] **Dominance Gate**: Execute only if chosen action dominates all alternatives across belief ensemble.
- [x] **Pre-Trade Loss Bound**: Compute worst-case fill outcome; veto if lower bound â‰¤ 0.
- [x] **Structural Exits**: Use liquidity-weighted unwind paths, not fixed stops.
- [x] **Portfolio-Level Antifragility**: Diversify by regime correlation, not instrument name.

---

## IX. Security, Provenance & Compliance

- [x] **Time Integrity Daemon**: Halt if system clock drift > threshold.
- [x] **Data Lineage Hashing**: Every decision references immutable feature hashes.
- [x] **Adversarial Feed Quarantine**: Suspicious ticks isolated until verified.
- [x] **Manipulation Sentinel**: Detect and block spoof-like order patterns.
- [x] **Compliance-Constrained Planner**: Rollouts obey regulatory and venue constraints.
- [x] **Plain-Language Rationale Export**: Each trade emits an explainable reason tied to observable factors.

---

## X. Cognitive Resource Management

- [ ] **Cognitive Scheduler**: Allocate compute by information gain potential.
- [x] **Signal ROI Monitor**: Track marginal predictive value of each data stream.
- [ ] **Graceful Degradation**: If sensors fail, revert to baseline policy with explicit uncertainty inflation.

---

## XI. CI/CD & Governance

- [x] **Automated Promotion/Reversion**: CI promotes only fully passing models; auto-rollbacks on gate regression.
- [x] **Gate Dashboard**: Real-time visual of each metric vs threshold.
- [x] **Immutable Audit Trail**: Sign and store every policy, belief, and runtime decision.
- [x] **Performance Covenant**: Gate advancement on sharpness, calibration, and exploitability metrics.

---

## XII. Deployment & Operations

- [ ] **Helm Failover with Replay Smoke Test**: Validate pod readiness by running historical replay.
- [x] **Docker Reproducibility**: Images tagged with policy hash and config fingerprint.
- [ ] **Terraform Infra Resilience**: Single-command rebuild of degraded nodes.
- [x] **Live Config Diff**: All toggles and flags logged with color-coded diff at startup.

### Ultimate Philosophy
EMP's final form is not predictive but *synchronous*. It doesnâ€™t guess; it co-oscillates with the market's hidden state. Each sensory and cognitive subsystem acts as a mirror, correcting distortion through feedback and evolution. When complete, the predator no longer chases signalsâ€”it embodies the market's structure and moves with it, flawlessly.
