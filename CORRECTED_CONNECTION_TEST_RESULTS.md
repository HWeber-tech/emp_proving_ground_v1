## CONNECTION RESULTS

### Price Connection Test ✅

**Configuration Used:**
```
Host: h51.p.ctrader.com
Port: 5201
SenderCompID: demo.icmarkets.9533708
TargetCompID: cServer
SenderSubID: QUOTE
TargetSubID: QUOTE
```

**Result:**
```
✅ Connected to h51.p.ctrader.com:5201
✅ Logon accepted by server
```

**Broker Response:**
```
8=FIX.4.4|9=102|35=A|34=1|49=cServer|50=QUOTE|52=20250729-03:59:54.711|56=demo.icmarkets.9533708|57=QUOTE|98=0|108=30|10=177|
```

**Analysis:** Price connection successful with corrected host and port.

### Trade Connection Test ❌

**Configuration Used:**
```
Host: h51.p.ctrader.com
Port: 5201
SenderCompID: demo.icmarkets.9533708
TargetCompID: cServer
SenderSubID: TRADE
TargetSubID: TRADE
```

**Result:**
```
✅ Connected to h51.p.ctrader.com:5201
❌ Logon rejected
```

**Broker Response:**
```
8=FIX.4.4|9=169|35=5|34=1|49=cServer|50=TRADE|52=20250729-03:59:56.878|56=demo.icmarkets.9533708|57=TRADE|58=TargetSubID is assigned with the unexpected value 'TRADE', expected 'QUOTE'|10=231|
```

**Error Message:** `TargetSubID is assigned with the unexpected value 'TRADE', expected 'QUOTE'`

**Analysis:** Trade connection rejected due to incorrect TargetSubID. Broker expects 'QUOTE' for both connections.

## KEY FINDINGS

### Successful Corrections ✅

1. **Host Address:** h51.p.ctrader.com works (corrected from demo-uk-eqx-01.p.c-trader.com)
2. **Port:** 5201 works (corrected from 5211/5212)
3. **Message Format:** Basic FIX message structure accepted
4. **Authentication:** Username/password authentication working

### New Issue Identified ❌

**TargetSubID Configuration:**
- **Expected by Broker:** 'QUOTE' for both price and trade connections
- **Current Implementation:** 'TRADE' for trade connection
- **Error:** `TargetSubID is assigned with the unexpected value 'TRADE', expected 'QUOTE'`

### IC Markets Specific Behavior

**Single Connection Type:**
- Both price and trade operations may use the same connection type
- TargetSubID should be 'QUOTE' for both sessions
- SenderSubID can differentiate between QUOTE and TRADE

---

## CONFIGURATION CORRECTIONS NEEDED

### Current (Partially Correct):
```
Price Connection:
- TargetSubID: QUOTE ✅
- SenderSubID: QUOTE ✅

Trade Connection:
- TargetSubID: TRADE ❌ (should be QUOTE)
- SenderSubID: TRADE ✅
```

### Required (Fully Correct):
```
Price Connection:
- TargetSubID: QUOTE ✅
- SenderSubID: QUOTE ✅

Trade Connection:
- TargetSubID: QUOTE ✅ (corrected)
- SenderSubID: TRADE ✅
```

## BROKER RESPONSE ANALYSIS

### Price Connection Response
```
Field 35: A (Logon response)
Field 49: cServer (sender)
Field 50: QUOTE (sender sub ID)
Field 56: demo.icmarkets.9533708 (target)
Field 57: QUOTE (target sub ID)
Field 98: 0 (no encryption)
Field 108: 30 (heartbeat interval)
```

**Status:** Accepted and authenticated

### Trade Connection Response
```
Field 35: 5 (Logout message)
Field 49: cServer (sender)
Field 50: TRADE (sender sub ID)
Field 56: demo.icmarkets.9533708 (target)
Field 57: TRADE (target sub ID)
Field 58: Error message about TargetSubID
```

**Status:** Rejected due to TargetSubID mismatch

---

## NEXT STEPS

### Immediate Fix Required
1. **Update Trade Connection Configuration:**
   - Change TargetSubID from 'TRADE' to 'QUOTE'
   - Keep SenderSubID as 'TRADE' for identification
   - Test both connections with corrected configuration

### Expected Outcome
- Both price and trade connections should authenticate successfully
- Same host/port (h51.p.ctrader.com:5201) for both connections
- TargetSubID 'QUOTE' for both, SenderSubID differentiates purpose

### Implementation Priority
1. **High Priority:** Fix TargetSubID configuration
2. **Medium Priority:** Test market data and order placement
3. **Low Priority:** Implement proper FIX Symbol ID handling

## PROGRESS SUMMARY

**Major Breakthrough:** ✅ Correct host and port identified and working  
**Authentication:** ✅ Working with correct credentials  
**Connection Type:** ⚠️ Needs TargetSubID correction for trade connection  
**Next Phase:** Fix TargetSubID and test full functionality  

**Overall Status:** Significant progress - core connection issues resolved, minor configuration adjustment needed.
