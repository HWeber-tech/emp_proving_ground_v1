# Legacy OpenAPI Setup Guide (Retired)

> **Status:** Deprecated â€“ retained only to signpost the FIX-only policy.

The previous version of this document described how to bootstrap the third-party
OpenAPI integration. That pathway has been removed in favour of the FIX
connectivity stack that now powers every supported workflow.

If you need to review historical decisions, consult the commit history prior to
the FIX policy shift. For day-to-day work follow
[`docs/policies/integration_policy.md`](policies/integration_policy.md) and the
FIX playbooks in `docs/fix_api/`.

The legacy content is intentionally omitted to avoid suggesting that the OpenAPI
tooling is still supported. If you discover new references to the deprecated
stack, please raise an issue so we can remove them promptly.
