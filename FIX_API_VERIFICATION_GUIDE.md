# IC Markets FIX API Verification Guide

## üîç The Problem

You have a demo account with IC Markets (account 9533708) and correct credentials, but the FIX API connection is being rejected with "Can't route request". This guide will help you determine if FIX API is enabled and how to activate it.

## üìã Key Findings from Research

### 1. IC Markets FIX API Policy
- **IC Markets does NOT provide direct FIX API** 
- **FIX API is only available through cTrader platform**
- You cannot get FIX API directly from IC Markets - it must go through cTrader

### 2. cTrader FIX API Requirements
- **FIX API credentials are automatically generated** with every cTrader trading account
- **No minimum deposit or trading volume required** for FIX API access
- **Demo accounts DO support FIX API** through cTrader

### 3. How FIX API Credentials Work
- Credentials are found **inside the cTrader platform settings**
- Two separate connections: **Price Connection** and **Trade Connection**
- Each has different credentials and serves different purposes

## üéØ Step-by-Step Verification Process

### Step 1: Verify Account Type
**Question:** Is your account 9533708 a **cTrader account** or **MetaTrader account**?

**How to Check:**
1. Log into your IC Markets client area
2. Check which platform your demo account was created for
3. Look for "cTrader" vs "MetaTrader" in account details

**Critical:** If it's a MetaTrader account, FIX API will **never work** - IC Markets explicitly states they don't provide FIX API for MT4/MT5.

### Step 2: Access cTrader Platform
**If you have a cTrader account:**

1. **Download cTrader** from IC Markets
2. **Log in** with your demo account credentials
3. **Open Settings** (cog icon in bottom left)
4. **Select "FIX API"** from settings menu

### Step 3: Check FIX API Credentials
**In cTrader FIX API settings, you should see:**

**Price Connection:**
- Host name
- Port number  
- Username
- Password
- SenderCompID
- TargetCompID

**Trade Connection:**
- Separate set of credentials for trading operations

### Step 4: Compare Credentials
**Compare what you see in cTrader with your current config:**

**Your Current Config:**
- SenderCompID: icmarkets.9533708
- TargetCompID: cServer
- TargetSubID: QUOTE/TRADE
- Username: 9533708
- Password: WNSE5822

**Check if these match exactly** what cTrader shows.

## üö® Most Likely Issues

### Issue 1: Wrong Account Type (HIGH PROBABILITY)
**Problem:** Account 9533708 might be a MetaTrader demo account, not cTrader
**Solution:** Create a new demo account specifically for cTrader platform

### Issue 2: Incorrect Credentials (MEDIUM PROBABILITY)
**Problem:** The credentials you're using don't match what cTrader generated
**Solution:** Get the actual credentials from cTrader platform settings

### Issue 3: Server Configuration (MEDIUM PROBABILITY)
**Problem:** Using wrong server endpoints or connection parameters
**Solution:** Use exact server details from cTrader FIX API settings

### Issue 4: Account Not Activated (LOW PROBABILITY)
**Problem:** Demo account exists but FIX API not enabled
**Solution:** Contact IC Markets support to activate FIX API

2. **Logon message accepted** (receive FIX MsgType=A response)
3. **Market data flows** (can subscribe to price feeds)
4. **Orders can be placed** (trade connection works)

### You'll know there's still an issue when:
1. **"Can't route request"** error persists
2. **Connection timeout** or immediate disconnection
3. **Authentication failed** messages
4. **No response** from server

## üí° Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Platform Verification
Always verify the platform type first - this is the most common issue

### Tip 2: Exact Credentials
FIX API is very sensitive to exact credential matching - even case matters

### Tip 3: Server Endpoints
Different brokers may use different server endpoints even with cTrader

### Tip 4: Community Resources
cTrader community forum is very active and helpful for FIX API issues

### Tip 5: Alternative APIs
If FIX API proves difficult, cTrader Open API might be easier to implement

This guide should help you systematically determine why your FIX API connection is failing and provide clear steps to resolve the issue.


## üî¨ Error Pattern Analysis

### Current Error Signature Analysis

**Your Error Pattern:**
```
üì• Raw response: b"8=FIX.4.4\x019=99\x0135=5\x0134=1\x0149=cServer\x0150=QUOTE\x0152=20250725-17:37:49.899\x0156=icmarkets.9533708\x0158=Can't route request\x0110=066\x01"
```

**Decoded FIX Message:**
- **8=FIX.4.4** ‚Üí Protocol version (correct)
- **9=99** ‚Üí Message length (correct)
- **35=5** ‚Üí **MsgType=5 = Logout** (server rejecting connection)
- **34=1** ‚Üí Sequence number (correct)
- **49=cServer** ‚Üí Sender (IC Markets server)
- **50=QUOTE** ‚Üí SenderSubID (price connection)
- **52=timestamp** ‚Üí Sending time (correct)
- **56=icmarkets.9533708** ‚Üí Target (your account)
- **58=Can't route request** ‚Üí **Rejection reason**
- **10=066** ‚Üí Checksum (correct)

### What This Error Means

**Positive Indicators:**
‚úÖ **Server received your message** (it responded)  
‚úÖ **Message format is correct** (server parsed it)  
‚úÖ **SSL connection works** (message transmitted)  
‚úÖ **Account number recognized** (server knows icmarkets.9533708)  
‚úÖ **Protocol compliance** (proper FIX 4.4 format)

**Negative Indicators:**
‚ùå **Authentication rejected** (Logout instead of Logon response)  
‚ùå **"Can't route request"** (specific rejection reason)  
‚ùå **Immediate disconnection** (server closes connection)

### Error Code Analysis: "Can't route request"

**This specific error typically means:**

1. **Account exists but lacks permissions** (most likely)
2. **Wrong server endpoint for this account type**
3. **Account not configured for FIX API access**
4. **Broker-side routing configuration issue**

**This error does NOT mean:**
- Wrong credentials (would be "Invalid login")
- Wrong message format (would be "Invalid message")
- Network issues (wouldn't get a response)
- Wrong protocol (wouldn't parse correctly)

### Comparison with Working Connections

**Successful FIX Logon should return:**
```
35=A  # MsgType=A (Logon response, not Logout)
58=   # No error text
```

**Your connection returns:**
```
35=5  # MsgType=5 (Logout = rejection)
58=Can't route request  # Error message
```

### Root Cause Probability Assessment

**90% Probability: Account Type Mismatch**
- Your account 9533708 is likely a **MetaTrader demo account**
- IC Markets explicitly states: **"We do not offer a FIX API connection into MetaTrader 4 or 5"**
- You need a **cTrader-specific demo account** for FIX API access

**8% Probability: Missing FIX API Activation**
- Account is cTrader but FIX API not enabled
- Requires manual activation by IC Markets support
- Less likely since cTrader accounts usually have FIX API by default

**2% Probability: Configuration Error**
- Wrong server endpoints or connection parameters
- Credential mismatch between your config and actual account
- Technical configuration issue

### Evidence Supporting MetaTrader Account Theory

**Evidence 1: Generic Account Number Format**
- Your account: `9533708`
- Typical cTrader accounts often have different numbering schemes
- This looks like a standard MT4/MT5 account number

**Evidence 2: Server Response Pattern**
- "Can't route request" is typical for wrong platform type
- Server recognizes account but can't route FIX requests to MT platform

**Evidence 3: IC Markets Policy**
- IC Markets clearly states no FIX API for MetaTrader
- All FIX API must go through cTrader platform

### Diagnostic Questions to Confirm

**Question 1: Platform Verification**
When you created demo account 9533708, did you:
- Select "MetaTrader 4" or "MetaTrader 5"? ‚Üí **FIX API won't work**
- Select "cTrader"? ‚Üí **FIX API should work**
- Not specify platform? ‚Üí **Likely defaulted to MetaTrader**

**Question 2: Login Method**
How do you currently access this demo account:
- Through MetaTrader 4/5 software? ‚Üí **Confirms MT account**
- Through cTrader software? ‚Üí **Confirms cTrader account**
- Only through web interface? ‚Üí **Platform unclear**

**Question 3: Account Details**
In your IC Markets client area, what does it show:
- Platform type for account 9533708
- Available trading platforms
- FIX API options or settings
