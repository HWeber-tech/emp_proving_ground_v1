"""Helpers for securely publishing operational telemetry events.

These utilities centralise the guarded publish-from-runtime â†’ fall back to global
bus pattern so individual modules do not need to implement their own blanket
``except Exception`` handling.  The helpers log contextual warnings for expected
failure modes and raise a typed :class:`EventPublishError` when an unexpected
exception bubbles up.  This keeps the telemetry path explicit while satisfying
the security roadmap requirement to replace broad exception handlers in
operational modules.
