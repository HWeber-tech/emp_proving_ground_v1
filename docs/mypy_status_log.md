# Mypy Weekly Status Log

This log tracks repository-wide mypy health after the CI recovery effort. Update this document every Friday (or at the end of each sprint) with the current snapshot, notable regressions, and upcoming focus areas.

## Update Process
1. Run `mypy --config-file mypy.ini src` and capture the full output to `mypy_snapshots/YYYY-MM-DD_full.txt`.
2. Record the error count, strictness changes, and any regressions below.
3. Link notable follow-up issues or pull requests.

  - Completed the final backlog sweep; all outstanding plan checkboxes are now closed.
  - Enabled repository-wide `check_untyped_defs` to surface regressions inside legacy modules.
  - Published onboarding guidance and dependency review checklist to prevent reintroducing untyped code.
