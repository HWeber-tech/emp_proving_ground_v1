# CI Health Snapshot

This dashboard summarizes the current state of the "CI" workflow and points to
where to find richer telemetry. Update the metrics after significant
infrastructure changes or once per sprint so stakeholders can confirm the
pipeline remains healthy at a glance.

## Latest pipeline status

| Signal | Value | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Last successful run | Refer to the GitHub Actions **CI** workflow page | Capture the run URL in team status updates. |
| Coverage (pytest `--cov`) | 76% (from [CI Baseline – 2025-09-16](../ci_baseline_report.md)) | Update when the coverage target moves. |
| Formatter rollout | Stage 0 complete – `tests/current/` enrolled in formatter allowlist | Guarded by `scripts/check_formatter_allowlist.py` in CI; Stage 1 (`src/system/`) prepped for the next PR. |
| Open CI alerts | Check the automatically managed **CI failure alerts** issue | Created/closed by `.github/workflows/ci-failure-alerts.yml`. |

## Where to look when something fails

1. **CI failure alerts issue** – Any failing `CI` run adds a comment to the
   `CI failure alerts` issue with the run link, triggering actor, and failing
   branch. Resolve the failure and close the issue to clear the alert backlog.
2. **Pytest log artifact** – The `tests` job uploads `pytest.log` on every run
   (success or failure). Download it to inspect the full trace beyond the tail
   mirrored in the step summary.
3. **Flake leaderboard** – Each run uploads `pytest_failures.json` and appends a
   summary generated by `scripts/flake_metadata_report.py`. Review the artifact
   (or the Step Summary) to spot recurring failures.
4. **CI baseline report** – The baseline in [`docs/ci_baseline_report.md`](../ci_baseline_report.md)
   lists historical hotspots and still-relevant remediation tickets.

## Maintenance checklist

- Confirm the alert issue auto-closes after the next successful run.
- Refresh coverage and formatter metrics after sizable refactors.
- Add notes about recurring flakes directly to this page so trends remain
  discoverable without mining historical logs.
