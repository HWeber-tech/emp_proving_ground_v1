# Reflection Intelligence Module (RIM) â€” TRM Design

## Executive Summary

The Reflection Intelligence Module (RIM) introduces a Tiny Recursive Model (TRM) runner that asynchronously inspects Decision Diaries and produces advisory suggestions for governance review. It operates off the critical path, refining candidate insights across a lightweight recursive loop before publishing JSONL artifacts to `artifacts/rim_suggestions/`. This design outlines data contracts, interfaces, telemetry, and safety rails required for a controlled rollout without modifying live trading logic.

## Interfaces

```python
class RIMInputAdapter:
    def load(self, window) -> RIMInputBatch: ...

class RIMEncoder:
    def encode(self, batch) -> tuple[x, y0]: ...

class RIMModelRunner:
    def run(self, x, y0, params) -> y_hat: ...

class RIMPostProcessor:
    def to_suggestions(self, y_hat) -> list[RIMSuggestion]: ...

class RIMPublisher:
    def publish(self, suggestions: list[RIMSuggestion]) -> ArtifactRef: ...
```

## Latency Stance

RIM operates asynchronously. Runs occur at end-of-session or scheduled intervals (`window_minutes` config) and **never** block live decision loops.

## Safety Controls

- Governance approval required prior to acting on suggestions.
- `enable_governance_gate` must remain `true`; publishers only enqueue to the policy ledger queue.
- Configuration `kill_switch` halts emissions while allowing diagnostics.
- Telemetry captures runtime percentiles and suggestion counts to spot anomalies.

## Configuration Keys

Referenced in [`config/reflection/rim.config.example.yml`](../../config/reflection/rim.config.example.yml):

- `window_minutes`, `min_entries`, `suggestion_cap`, `confidence_floor`
- `enable_governance_gate`, `publish_channel`, `kill_switch`
- `telemetry.log_dir`
- `trm_params.K_outer`, `trm_params.n_inner`, `trm_params.halt_enabled`

## Training Plan (Documentation Only)

1. Source supervised labels from simulation/backtest outcomes using Decision Diaries plus curated annotations.
2. Periodically retrain (monthly/quarterly) with drift checks on feature distributions and suggestion acceptance.
3. Maintain shadow datasets for ablations and fairness/robustness audits.

## Evaluation Plan

- **Precision/Recall:** Compare suggestions against governance decisions and post-hoc labels.
- **Acceptance Rate:** Track governance-approved suggestions vs. total emitted.
- **Downstream Impact:** Measure changes to Sharpe, drawdown, and win/loss rates during pilots.
- **Ablations:** Remove latent updates (`n_inner=0`) or reduce outer loops to assess TRM contribution.

## Telemetry

Monitor:

- `p50`/`p95` runtime per batch.
- Suggestion emission rate (per window and per strategy).
- Governance acceptance percentage and impact deltas (Sharpe, drawdown).

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
| --- | --- |
| Spurious correlations in diaries | Use simulation diversity, cross-validation, and governance reviews. |
| Regime shifts | Rolling retrains with drift detection on aggregates. |
| Over-suggestion / alert fatigue | Enforce `suggestion_cap` and `confidence_floor`; monitor acceptance. |

## Acceptance Criteria Checklist

- [ ] Shadow run emits JSONL suggestions matching `interfaces/rim_types.json`.
- [ ] Governance gate loads suggestions without errors.
- [ ] Telemetry file contains runtime + acceptance metrics.
- [ ] Markdown lint & link check pass.

## Non-regression Checklist

- [ ] No changes under `risk/` or `execution/` packages.
- [ ] No new heavy ML dependencies in requirements.

## Dependencies & Open Questions

- Confirm governance ingestion API for policy ledger queue.
- Define retention enforcement job (cron or governance service).
- Align with data platform on diary enrichment cadence.
