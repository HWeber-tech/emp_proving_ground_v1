# EMP Proving Ground v1 - Architecture Reality (Authoritative)

## Architecture Overview

This document provides an honest assessment of the current architectural state and implementation reality of the EMP Proving Ground system and is the canonical truth for current status.

Key policies:
- FIX-only broker connectivity. OpenAPI is disabled across code and CI.
- All calculations belong in the sensory layer; integration through the sensory cortex.
- Reports are written under `docs/reports/`.

## Current Architecture Status

### üèóÔ∏è **Framework Architecture**: Defined but Not Implemented

The system has a well-defined architectural framework with clear separation of concerns, but most components exist as interfaces and mock implementations rather than functional systems.

## Component Architecture

### Core Layer (`src/core/`)

**Status**: Interface definitions with minimal implementation

**Components**:
- `interfaces.py`: Abstract base classes (61 methods with `...` implementations)
- `exceptions.py`: Exception handling framework ‚úÖ
- `validation.py`: Validation framework ‚úÖ
- `models.py`: Data models and structures
- `configuration.py`: Configuration management framework

**Reality**: Core interfaces are defined but not implemented. Exception and validation frameworks are functional.

### Operational Layer (`src/operational/`)

**Status**: Limited working components

**Components**:
- `fix_connection_manager.py`: FIX session bootstrapping helpers and typed configuration hooks
- `mock_fix.py`: Simplified FIX manager used for tests and rehearsals

**Reality**: Legacy IC Markets connectors have been removed; only the connection
manager scaffolding and mocks remain. There is no live broker execution, only
bootstrap wiring for future pilots.

### Evolution Layer (`src/evolution/`)

**Status**: Framework only, no functional genetic algorithms

**Components**:
- `engine/`: Population management interfaces
- `fitness/`: Fitness evaluation frameworks
- `selection/`: Selection algorithm interfaces
- `mutation/`: Mutation operation interfaces

**Reality**: All components are abstract interfaces or mock implementations. No actual genetic algorithm execution.

### Trading Layer (`src/trading/`)

**Status**: Interface definitions, no real trading logic

**Components**:
- `execution/`: Order execution interfaces
- `strategies/`: Strategy framework
- `risk/`: Risk management interfaces
- `portfolio/`: Portfolio management framework

**Reality**: Framework exists but no functional trading strategies, risk management, or portfolio execution.

### Data Layer (`src/data_integration/`)

**Status**: Mock data sources only

**Components**:
- Data fusion frameworks
- Mock data generators
- Interface definitions for real data sources

**Reality**: No real market data integration. All data sources are mock implementations.

### Sensory Layer (`src/sensory/`)

**Status**: Analytics framework with some implementation

**Components**:
- Technical indicator implementations
- Market analysis frameworks
- Data processing pipelines

**Reality**: Some technical indicators implemented, but operating on mock data sources.

## Architectural Strengths

### ‚úÖ Well-Defined Interfaces
- Clear separation of concerns
- Abstract base classes properly defined
- Consistent interface patterns

### ‚úÖ Modular Design
- Clean layer separation
- Pluggable component architecture
- Testable design patterns

### ‚úÖ Exception Handling
- Comprehensive exception framework
- Proper error propagation
- Logging integration

## Architectural Gaps

### ‚ùå Implementation Deficit
- 44 files contain `pass` statements
- Most interfaces have no concrete implementations
- Mock implementations throughout

### ‚ùå Data Integration
- No real market data sources
- No broker integrations beyond basic FIX authentication
- All data processing operates on synthetic data

### ‚ùå Trading Logic
- No implemented trading strategies
- No real risk management
- No portfolio management implementation

### ‚ùå Testing Architecture
- Limited test coverage
- No integration testing with real data
- Framework testing only

## Architecture Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation Implementation
1. Implement core population management
2. Add real market data sources
3. Build basic genetic algorithm execution
4. Implement fundamental risk management

### Phase 2: Trading Implementation
1. Develop concrete trading strategies
2. Implement real order execution
3. Build portfolio management
4. Add comprehensive risk controls

### Phase 3: Production Architecture
1. Performance optimization
2. Scalability improvements
3. Monitoring and observability
4. Production deployment architecture

## Development Principles

### Truth-First Architecture
- All architectural claims verified against implementation
- Mock components clearly identified
- No false production-ready claims

### Interface-First Design
- Define interfaces before implementation
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Enable pluggable implementations

### Testable Architecture
- Design for testability
- Separate concerns for unit testing
- Enable integration testing

## For Architects and Developers

When working with this architecture:

1. **Understand the current state**: Most components are frameworks, not implementations
2. **Follow interface contracts**: Implement defined interfaces completely
3. **Maintain separation**: Keep mock and real implementations clearly separated
4. **Update documentation**: Reflect actual implementation status
5. **Test thoroughly**: Validate implementations against real-world conditions
