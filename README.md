The EMP Proving Ground is not just another backtesting engine. It is a **Darwinian crucible** designed to solve the fundamental problem of algorithmic trading: **static strategies fail in dynamic markets.**

Traditional trading bots are brittle; they are optimized for a specific set of historical patterns and break as soon as the market regime changes or they encounter sophisticated manipulation. The EMP project takes a different approach. We don't code trading strategies; we create the conditions for them to **emerge** through evolution.
