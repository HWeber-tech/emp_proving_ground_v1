# Legacy Documents

These documents refer to deprecated OpenAPI-based workflows or pre-FIX-only materials.
They are retained for historical reference and are excluded from CI OpenAPI checks.
All files in this directory should link back to the
[`Integration Policy`](../../docs/policies/integration_policy.md) so contributors know
the cTrader paths remain blocked.
