# Frontier Research Brief — Q1 2025

**Prepared by:** Research Council 2025-01-31  
**Scope:** Summarise experimentation outcomes against EMP Encyclopedia hypotheses for the Q1 paper-trading cycle.

## Executive highlights

- The MA crossover genetic algorithm improved composite fitness from 3.91 to 4.17 on the synthetic Tier-0 basket while respecting VaR/drawdown guardrails. 【F:artifacts/evolution/ma_crossover/manifest.json†L1-L115】
- Sensory drift telemetry reported stable variance within ±1.4σ across HOW/WHEN sensors, enabling confidence in deploying new strategy hooks. 【F:docs/status/high_impact_roadmap_detail.md†L33-L47】
- Risk analytics modules (VaR, expected shortfall, volatility targeting) operated within planned exposure envelopes throughout the evaluation period. 【F:docs/status/high_impact_roadmap_detail.md†L63-L94】

## Experiment summaries

### Genetic algorithm uplift

- **Dataset:** `synthetic_trend_v1` (length 512) with deterministic seed 2025. 【F:artifacts/evolution/ma_crossover/manifest.json†L25-L35】
- **Configuration:** Population size 24, 18 generations, crossover 0.7, mutation 0.25. 【F:artifacts/evolution/ma_crossover/manifest.json†L6-L24】
- **Outcome:** Best genome short window 8, long window 169, risk fraction 0.3565, with Sharpe 3.92 and total return 13.07%. 【F:artifacts/evolution/ma_crossover/manifest.json†L36-L91】
- **Action:** Promote genome to supervised paper trading backlog and schedule live-paper replay via `python scripts/generate_evolution_lab.py --seed 2025`. 【F:artifacts/evolution/ma_crossover/manifest.json†L98-L115】

### Sensory cortex validation

- Drift evaluation confirmed all organs (HOW, WHAT, WHEN, WHY, ANOMALY) emitting within tolerance thresholds. 【F:docs/status/high_impact_roadmap_detail.md†L33-L59】
- Backfilled session analytics and WHY narrative hooks feed directly into strategy registry, supporting the volatility/momentum stack.
- Next action: extend live-paper experiments with automated tuning loops via `operations.evolution_tuning.evaluate_evolution_tuning`. 【F:docs/status/high_impact_roadmap_detail.md†L38-L47】

### Execution and risk readiness

- Order lifecycle dry runs captured full FIX event coverage with reconciliations stored in CI artifacts. 【F:docs/status/high_impact_roadmap_detail.md†L66-L94】
- Nightly risk report pipeline executed without threshold breaches, confirming readiness to layer additional alpha sources.
- Next checkpoint: expand drop-copy reconciliation coverage and regulatory telemetry per Stream C charter. 【F:docs/status/high_impact_roadmap_detail.md†L48-L94】
