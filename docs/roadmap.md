# AlphaTrade â€” ROADMAP.md (vNext, Q4 2025)

> **North Star**: Build **AlphaTrade** â€” a governed, continuouslyâ€‘learning trading organism that runs a **Perception â†’ Adaptation â†’ Reflection** loop with deterministic rails and risk-as-law.

**How to use this roadmap**
- Treat this as a living checklist. Check off items youâ€™ve completed (`[x]`) and keep open items as `[ ]`.
- Each milestone has **deliverables** and **acceptance criteria** (DoD). Promotion to the next milestone requires all DoD to pass.
- Labels: `[core]` Perception/Belief, `[adapt]` Policy/Router/Evolution, `[reflect]` RIM/TRM/Diary, `[risk]` Risk/Governance, `[obs]` Observability/Telemetry, `[sim]` Replay/Sim/Paper, `[ops]` Deploy/Runtime, `[docs]` Documentation.

## M0 â€” Baseline & Safety Gates (0â€“3 days)

**Deliverables**
- [ ] `[risk]` Preâ€‘trade invariants verified (exposure, price bands, inventory, drawdown); killâ€‘switch wired.
- [x] `[adapt]` Feature flags for **fastâ€‘weights**, **linear attention**, and **exploration** (on/off per env). _Progress: `AdaptationFeatureToggles` resolves SystemConfig posture into fast-weight, linear-attention, and exploration flags, flows them through the operational backbone pipeline and runtime, and regression coverage proves AlphaTrade respects environment defaults while diary metadata mirrors forced fast-weight shutdowns.【F:src/thinking/adaptation/feature_toggles.py†L1-L164】【F:src/data_foundation/pipelines/operational_backbone.py†L35-L213】【F:tools/data_ingest/run_operational_backbone.py†L287-L313】【F:src/runtime/predator_app.py†L260-L288】【F:src/orchestration/alpha_trade_runner.py†L120-L198】【F:tests/thinking/test_adaptation_feature_toggles.py†L1-L86】【F:tests/orchestration/test_alpha_trade_runner.py†L268-L298】_
- [ ] `[obs]` Minimal **heartbeat** & latency counters (ingestâ†’signalâ†’orderâ†’ack p50/p99/p99.9).
- [x] `[docs]` Update **CONTRIBUTING** with run profiles (sim/paper/liveâ€‘shadow) and featureâ€‘flag table. _Progress: CONTRIBUTING.md now documents simulation, paper, and liveâ€‘shadow launch recipes alongside a featureâ€‘flag matrix that complements the workflow guide in `docs/development/contributing.md`, giving operators the runtime posture and evidence checklist they need for roadmap gates.【F:CONTRIBUTING.md†L1-L96】_

**Acceptance (DoD)**
- [ ] `[risk]` Synthetic invariant breach â†’ order rejected; killâ€‘switch test passes.
- [ ] `[obs]` Heartbeat visible during a 30â€‘minute run; latency counters populated.
- [x] `[ops]` Deterministic run reproducible via one command (`make run-sim` or equivalent). _Progress: The `run-sim` wrapper now boots the bootstrap runtime with deterministic defaults, writes summaries/diaries, exposes CLI overrides, and ships a Makefile target plus regression coverage so a single command reproduces the acceptance drill with evidence artifacts.【F:tools/runtime/run_simulation.py†L1-L210】【F:tests/tools/test_run_simulation.py†L1-L138】【F:Makefile†L103-L121】_

## M1 â€” Understanding Loop v1 (Weeks 1â€“2)

**Deliverables**
- [ ] `[core]` **BeliefEmitter** with **ReLU + topâ€‘k sparsity**; persisted `belief_snapshots` (DuckDB/Parquet).
- [x] `[core]` **RegimeFSM v1** (ruleâ€‘based thresholds + confidence + transitions logged). _Progress: RegimeFSM now emits structured transition events with latency/volatility context, keeps a bounded transition history, and exposes health metrics under regression coverage so regime flips remain auditable for policy routing.【F:src/understanding/belief.py†L695-L878】【F:tests/understanding/test_belief_updates.py†L327-L394】_
- [ ] `[adapt]` **LinearAttentionRouter** (flagâ€‘guarded) for policy arbitration.
- [x] `[adapt]` **Fastâ€‘weights (Ïƒ) kernel** (Hebbian decay + potentiation); **lowâ€‘rank** implementation; clamps/decay. _Progress: UnderstandingRouter now applies feature-gated Hebbian adapters with deterministic decay, persists multiplier history, and exposes fast-weight metrics so governance can audit adaptive runs under regression coverage.【F:src/understanding/router.py†L70-L240】【F:tests/understanding/test_understanding_router.py†L1-L185】_
- [x] `[reflect]` **Decision Diary** table + writer (belief, policy_hash, exec_topo, risk_template, features, decision, ex_post). _Progress: DecisionDiaryStore normalises policy decisions, attaches probe ownership, records reflection summaries, and the CLI exports Markdown/JSON transcripts with guardrail tests for governance evidence.【F:src/understanding/decision_diary.py†L1-L240】【F:tests/tools/test_decision_diary_cli.py†L1-L188】_
- [ ] `[reflect]` 3â€“5 **synapse probes** (e.g., opening auction, sweep risk, imbalance surge). _Progress: WHAT sensor now emits trend-strength telemetry, metadata, and lineage parity so probes discriminate bullish versus bearish sequences under regression coverage.【F:src/sensory/what/what_sensor.py†L83-L200】【F:tests/sensory/test_primary_dimension_sensors.py†L35-L83】_
- [ ] `[reflect]` **Drift Sentry** (Pageâ€“Hinkley/CUSUM) + actions (freeze exploration, halve size) + â€œtheory packetâ€.
- [ ] `[obs]` Graph diagnostics nightly job: degree hist, modularity, coreâ€“periphery (thresholds set).

**Acceptance (DoD)**
- [ ] `[sim]` **Determinism**: Replay same tape + seeds â‡’ identical diary & PnL.
- [x] `[adapt]` **Regimeâ€‘aware routing**: regime flip â‡’ topology switch within N ms; proven in diary. _Progress: PolicyRouter enforces topology switches on regime changes, tracks switch latency, and reflection summaries capture the transition under dedicated pytest coverage.【F:src/thinking/adaptation/policy_router.py†L201-L520】【F:tests/thinking/test_policy_router.py†L60-L152】_
- [ ] `[reflect]` **Drift throttle**: injected alpha decay â‡’ sentry fires within 1 decision step; theory packet written.
- [ ] `[obs]` Attribution coverage â‰¥ **90%** of orders have belief + probes; no Ïƒ explosions (bounded norms). _Progress: AlphaTradeLoopRunner now attaches belief/probe attribution payloads to trade metadata and decision diaries, while TradingManager records `orders_with_attribution` and `attribution_coverage` stats and warns when coverage slips below the 90% target under guardrail tests for executed intents.【F:src/orchestration/alpha_trade_runner.py†L168-L234】【F:src/trading/trading_manager.py†L3587-L3637】【F:tests/trading/test_trading_manager_execution.py†L760-L821】_
- [ ] `[risk]` **0** invariant violations in a 4â€‘hour sim run.

---

## M2 â€” Evolution Engine v1 (Weeks 3â€“6)

**Genotype/Phenotype & Operators**
- [ ] `[adapt]` **StrategyGenotype/Phenotype** contracts (fields: features, exec topology, risk template, tunables).
- [ ] `[adapt]` Operators: `op_add_feature`, `op_drop_feature`, `op_swap_execution_topology`, `op_tighten_risk`.
- [ ] `[adapt]` Operator constraints (allowed domain, regimeâ€‘aware rules).

**Search & Selection**
- [ ] `[adapt]` **Tournament selection** over **regime grid** (multiâ€‘regime fitness table).
- [ ] `[adapt]` **Novelty archive** (genotype signature + probe vector; novelty score).
- [ ] `[sim]` **Compute scheduler** for candidate replays (budgeted batches, fairâ€‘share across instruments).

**Budgeted, Safe Exploration**
- [ ] `[adapt]` **Global exploration budget** (â‰¤ X% flow, mutate every K decisions) enforced in router.
- [ ] `[adapt]` **Counterfactual guardrails** (passive vs aggro delta bounds) for live candidates.
- [ ] `[reflect]` **Autoâ€‘freeze** exploration on drift or risk warnings (hooks wired).

**Provenance & Governance**
- [ ] `[reflect]` **Policy Ledger**: promotion checklist (OOS regimeâ€‘grid, leakage checks, risk audit) enforced.
- [ ] `[reflect]` `rebuild_strategy(policy_hash)` produces byteâ€‘identical runtime config.
- [ ] `[docs]` Promotion gate documented (thresholds, required artifacts).

**Acceptance (DoD)**
- [ ] `[sim]` Spawn â†’ score â†’ **promote** a **new topology** (not just parameter tweak) via ledger gates.
- [ ] `[risk]` **0** invariant violations during exploration; freeze triggers on violations/drift immediately.
- [ ] `[obs]` Evolution KPIs live: timeâ€‘toâ€‘candidate, promotion rate, budget usage, rollback latency.
- [ ] `[adapt]` p50/p99 decision latency **not worse** than M1 baseline.

---

## M3 â€” Governed Reflection Feedback (Weeks 5â€“8)

**Deliverables**
- [ ] `[reflect]` **RIM/TRM proposal schema** (confidence, rationale, affected regimes, evidence pointers). _Progress: RIMSuggestion contracts now ship a traceability payload that records code/config/model hashes, batch diary slices, and target strategies, with TRM runner and application tests asserting the evidence pointers persist through governance queues and ledger metadata.【F:interfaces/rim_types.json†L81-L178】【F:tests/reflection/test_trm_runner.py†L93-L166】【F:tests/reflection/test_trm_application.py†L18-L129】【F:docs/design/trm_reflection_design.md†L95-L110】_
- [x] `[reflect]` Governance rule: **autoâ€‘apply** proposals IF (a) OOS uplift â‰¥ threshold, (b) 0 risk hits in replay, (c) budget available. _Progress: Auto-apply guard now loads thresholds from `config/reflection/rim.config.example.yml`, evaluates uplift, risk hits, and budget utilisation inside `TRMRunner`, and surfaces evaluations in the governance queue and digest with regression coverage documenting rejection reasons.【F:config/reflection/rim.config.example.yml†L13-L24】【F:src/reflection/trm/config.py†L44-L169】【F:src/reflection/trm/runner.py†L138-L213】【F:tests/reflection/test_trm_runner.py†L70-L150】_
- [x] `[reflect]` Shadow job: nightly RIM run â‡’ proposals â‡’ governance gate â‡’ staged application (flagâ€‘guarded). _Progress: The shadow runner now enforces the governance gate, writes skip digests, and stamps auto-apply decisions into the queue/markdown artifacts, with regression coverage ensuring nightly RIM runs stage approved changes without bypassing safeguards.【F:tools/rim_shadow_run.py†L160-L222】【F:src/reflection/trm/governance.py†L19-L247】【F:tests/tools/test_rim_shadow_run.py†L44-L139】【F:tests/reflection/test_trm_governance.py†L16-L126】_
- [ ] `[reflect]` Ledger entries for accepted/rejected proposals + human signâ€‘offs. _Progress: Ledger releases now surface metadata/policy deltas alongside staged approvals so governance packets inherit the recorded reviewers and auto-applied changes in the exported posture snapshot.【F:src/governance/policy_ledger.py†L572-L595】_

**Acceptance (DoD)**
- [x] `[sim]` At least **one** RIMâ€‘driven change applied via governance rule in sim/paper. _Progress: Paper runtime now ingests auto-applied TRM queue entries, tags the ledger with `rim-auto` approvals, persists threshold deltas, and exposes the metadata in release posture exports with regression coverage across the helper and paper simulation flow.【F:src/reflection/trm/application.py†L17-L159】【F:tests/reflection/test_trm_application.py†L49-L100】【F:src/runtime/predator_app.py†L2557-L2585】【F:tests/runtime/test_paper_trading_simulation_runner.py†L191-L278】_
- [ ] `[reflect]` Every proposal traceable (input diary slice, code hash, config hash).
- [ ] `[risk]` No autoâ€‘applied proposal can bypass invariants or budget constraints.

---

## M4 â€” Paper 24/7 & Observability (Weeks 6â€“10)

**Deliverables**
- [x] `[ops]` Containerized runtime (Docker) + deployment profile (dev/paper); health checks. _Progress: Docker profiles now package the production runtime with Timescale/Redis/Kafka dependencies, proactive health checks, shared env overlays, and matching SystemConfig presets under regression coverage and updated setup docs so operators can launch dev or paper stacks with one compose command.【F:docker/runtime/docker-compose.dev.yml†L1-L136】【F:config/deployment/runtime_paper.yaml†L1-L38】【F:docs/development/setup.md†L62-L93】【F:tests/governance/test_system_config_runtime_profiles.py†L1-L57】_
- [ ] `[core]` Live market data ingest configured (API keys, symbols, session calendars).
- [ ] `[sim]` **Paper broker** connector smokeâ€‘tested; failover & reconnect logic. _Progress: Paper trading simulation reports persist aggregated order summaries with side/symbol splits and broker failover snapshots so operators inherit audit-ready context, locked by regression coverage.【F:src/runtime/paper_simulation.py†L339-L367】【F:tests/runtime/test_paper_trading_simulation_runner.py†L132-L188】【F:tests/integration/test_paper_trading_simulation.py†L394-L429】_
- [ ] `[obs]` Monitoring: dashboards (latency, throughput, P&L swings, memory); alerts on tail spikes and drift.
- [ ] `[ops]` Replay harness scheduled nightly; artifacts persisted (diary, ledger, drift reports).

**Acceptance (DoD)**
- [ ] `[sim]` **24/7 paper run** for â‰¥ 7 days with **zero** invariant violations, stable p99 latency, and no memory leaks. _Progress: Paper run guardian now monitors long-horizon paper sessions, enforces latency/invariant thresholds, tracks memory growth, and persists summaries for governance review via the runtime CLI with pytest coverage for breach detection and exports.【F:src/runtime/paper_run_guardian.py†L1-L360】【F:tests/runtime/test_paper_run_guardian.py†L1-L184】【F:src/runtime/cli.py†L1-L220】_
- [ ] `[obs]` Alerts fired & acknowledged in drill; dashboards show stable metrics.
- [x] `[docs]` Incident playbook validated (killâ€‘switch, replay, rollback). _Progress: Dedicated validator CLI now executes kill-switch, nightly replay, and trade rollback drills, writes evidence packs, and is paired with a refreshed runbook and regression coverage so incident rehearsals consistently capture pass/fail artifacts.【F:tools/operations/incident_playbook_validation.py†L44-L255】【F:docs/operations/runbooks/incident_playbook_validation.md†L1-L66】【F:tests/tools/test_incident_playbook_validation.py†L9-L48】_

## M5 â€” Tinyâ€‘Capital Live Pilot (Weeks 10â€“12, gated)

**Deliverables**
- [ ] `[ops]` Live broker integration (sandbox/prod) behind same interfaces; credential rotation & secrets mgmt.
- [x] `[risk]` â€œLimitedâ€‘liveâ€ governance gate (explicit ledger entry required to enable any real trades). _Progress: Ledger release manager now caps default limited-live stages to pilot without a policy record, the release router forces paper routes until a ledger entry exists, and regression coverage asserts forced-paper metadata for missing governance approvals so real trading stays disabled by default.【F:src/governance/policy_ledger.py†L550-L623】【F:src/trading/execution/release_router.py†L86-L310】【F:tests/governance/test_policy_ledger.py†L331-L345】【F:tests/trading/test_release_execution_router.py†L88-L167】_
- [ ] `[ops]` Endâ€‘toâ€‘end audit log export; compliance artifact pack.

**Acceptance (DoD)**
- [ ] `[ops]` Liveâ€‘pilot drill: turn on tiny capital; trigger killâ€‘switch; rollback; reconcile â€” all green.
- [ ] `[risk]` **0** invariant violations; exploration locked to **0%** in live (candidates only in paper).

---

## Continuous Quality Bars (always on)

- [ ] `[risk]` Weekly invariants audit & redâ€‘team scenarios (extreme volatility, symbol halts, bad prints).
- [ ] `[reflect]` Diary coverage â‰¥ **95%**; missingâ€‘data alerts.
- [ ] `[obs]` Graph health in band: modularity, heavyâ€‘tail degree (alerts on collapse/overâ€‘smoothing).
- [ ] `[docs]` Honest README & system diagram reflect current reality (mock vs real clearly labeled).

---

## Backlog / Niceâ€‘toâ€‘Haves

- [x] `[adapt]` (Âµ+Î») evolution mode in addition to tournament selection. _Progress: EvolutionConfig now exposes a `mu_plus_lambda` mode with survivor retention, configurable offspring counts, and fitness-safe parent sampling, and the regression suite locks survivor preservation plus invalid config guards.【F:src/core/evolution/engine.py†L45-L320】【F:tests/current/test_evolution_engine_basic.py†L1-L58】_
- [x] `[adapt]` `op_mix_strategies` (ensembles) with stability penalties (switching frictions). _Progress: The new strategy mixer operator blends scored tactics with friction, decay, and bounds enforcement, exports typed dataclasses, and ships regression coverage for score prioritisation, friction decay, and max-share enforcement so ensemble evolution can progress beyond the backlog stub.【F:src/evolution/mutation/strategy_mixer.py†L1-L200】【F:tests/evolution/test_strategy_mix_operator.py†L1-L118】_
- [ ] `[reflect]` Counterfactual explainers per trade (why not alternative topology).
- [x] `[core]` HMMâ€‘based RegimeFSM v2; learned transition priors. _Progress: RegimeFSM now embeds an online Gaussian HMM that learns transition counts, emits regime probability matrices, and exposes the learned parameters through metadata and health checks with regression coverage proving priors update across belief sequences.【F:src/understanding/belief.py†L905-L1250】【F:tests/understanding/test_belief_updates.py†L321-L456】_
- [x] `[obs]` Prometheus/Grafana (or cloud) monitoring; SLO alerting as code. _Progress: Prometheus rule files, Grafana provisioning, and the operations runbook now live in-repo with tests guarding alert coverage and dashboard wiring so SLO panels and alerts stay reproducible.【F:config/prometheus/emp_rules.yml†L1-L65】【F:config/grafana/dashboards/json/emp_observability.json†L1-L200】【F:docs/operations/prometheus_grafana.md†L1-L26】【F:tests/config/test_prometheus_monitoring.py†L1-L50】【F:tests/config/test_grafana_dashboard.py†L1-L45】_
- [ ] `[ops]` K8s deployment (dev/paper); sealed secrets; autoscaling for replay jobs.
- [x] `[docs]` Whitepaper v1 (architecture + governance + empirical results). _Progress: Whitepaper v1 now inventories each loop layer, tabulates guardrail evidence, and publishes reproducible command drills so reviewers trace roadmap Definition-of-Done checks to executable artifacts and context packs.【F:docs/AlphaTrade_Whitepaper.md†L1-L77】_

---

## Success Metrics (Northâ€‘Star KPIs)

- [ ] **Timeâ€‘toâ€‘candidate** â‰¤ 24h (idea â†’ scored in replay). _Progress: Findings memory now exposes SLA analytics and a CLI reports average/median/p90 turnaround and breach details so the experimentation loop can track adherence in real time under regression coverage.【F:emp/core/findings_memory.py†L1-L460】【F:emp/cli/emp_cycle_metrics.py†L1-L120】【F:tests/emp_cycle/test_time_to_candidate.py†L1-L86】_
- [ ] **Promotion integrity**: 100% promoted strategies have ledger artifacts & pass regimeâ€‘grid gates. _Progress: Strategy registry now bootstraps a config-driven PromotionGuard that enforces stage requirements, ledger/diary paths, and regime coverage, with tests proving missing regimes block approvals until coverage is recorded.【F:config/governance/promotion_guard.yaml†L1-L20】【F:src/governance/strategy_registry.py†L45-L224】【F:tests/governance/test_strategy_registry.py†L145-L268】_
- [ ] **Guardrail integrity**: risk violations in paper/live = **0**; nearâ€‘misses logged & actioned. _Progress: Risk guardrail incidents now start a force-paper cooldown, snapshot remaining time and reason into execution stats, propagate `risk_guardrail` blocks onto intents, and trigger release routing to keep near misses on paper, with regression coverage proving the forced routes and telemetry payloads.【F:src/trading/trading_manager.py†L546-L590】【F:src/trading/trading_manager.py†L2011-L2219】【F:src/trading/execution/release_router.py†L433-L547】【F:tests/trading/test_trading_manager_execution.py†L730-L872】_
- [ ] **Attribution coverage** â‰¥ 90% (orders with belief + probes + brief explanation). _Progress: Execution stats now surface attribution coverage metrics and end-to-end tests assert executed trades retain the enriched payload, enabling governance dashboards to track the 90% target quantitatively.【F:src/trading/trading_manager.py†L3587-L3637】【F:tests/trading/test_trading_manager_execution.py†L760-L821】_
- [ ] **Operator leverage**: experiments/week/person â†‘ without quality loss.

---

## Commands & Artifacts (to standardize)

- [x] `make run-sim` â€” deterministic sim/replay run (acceptance tests). _Progress: New tooling wraps the bootstrap runtime into `make run-sim`, wiring environment defaults, summary/diary exports, and pytest coverage so the acceptance drill is a single reproducible command.【F:Makefile†L103-L121】【F:tools/runtime/run_simulation.py†L1-L210】【F:tests/tools/test_run_simulation.py†L1-L138】_
- [x] `make run-paper` â€” paper 24/7 profile with dashboards. _Progress: Makefile routes to the runtime CLI `paper-run` subcommand which boots the guardian, streams progress, and persists structured summaries for dashboards under pytest coverage.【F:Makefile†L90-L98】【F:src/runtime/cli.py†L1-L220】【F:src/runtime/paper_run_guardian.py†L1-L360】【F:tests/runtime/test_paper_run_guardian.py†L1-L184】_
- [ ] `make rebuild-policy HASH=...` â€” reproduce phenotype from ledger.
- [x] `make rim-shadow` â€” nightly RIM/TRM proposals + governance report. _Progress: The `rim-shadow` target now drives the governance-gated shadow runner, emitting suggestions plus queue/digest markdown artifacts with auto-apply annotations under pytest coverage so nightly cron jobs stay audit-ready.【F:Makefile†L67-L85】【F:tools/rim_shadow_run.py†L160-L222】【F:tests/tools/test_rim_shadow_run.py†L44-L139】_
- [x] `artifacts/` â€” diaries, drift reports, ledger exports, evolution KPIs (dated folders). _Progress: `archive_artifact` standardises dated evidence mirrors and now runs from the decision diary, nightly replay job, policy ledger, and evolution lab exporter with coverage so compliance packs auto-land in `artifacts/<kind>/<date>/<run>/` without manual curation.【F:src/artifacts/archive.py†L1-L95】【F:src/understanding/decision_diary.py†L447-L465】【F:src/governance/policy_ledger.py†L394-L420】【F:tools/operations/nightly_replay_job.py†L573-L590】【F:scripts/generate_evolution_lab.py†L171-L185】【F:tests/artifacts/test_archive.py†L1-L45】_

### Notes
- If you have already implemented any item above, **check it now** to keep the roadmap honest.
- Keep feature flags conservative by default (`fast-weights=off`, `exploration=off`, `auto-governed-feedback=off`) and enable progressively per environment.
