# Paths (files or directories) that have been fully normalized with `ruff format`.
#
# Each entry should be relative to the repository root. Blank lines and lines starting
# with `#` are ignored. Keep the list alphabetized so diffs remain readable.
#
# Example:
# src/system/
# tests/current/test_scientific_stack_guard.py
#
# The allowlist starts empty; populate it incrementally as teams finish formatting
# individual packages.
