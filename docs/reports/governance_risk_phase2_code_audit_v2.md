# Governance & Risk Code Audit – Phase II Completion (2025-10-10)

## Quick Fixes
- `SafetyManager.from_config` now routes `confirm_live` through a strict boolean
  normaliser so environment-provided strings such as `"false"` no longer bypass
  the live confirmation gate.  Misconfigured payloads raise a `ValueError`
  during bootstrap instead of silently promoting unsafe defaults.  The helper
  also accepts numeric sentinels (0/1) to keep backwards compatibility while
  making the guardrail explicit.  【F:src/governance/safety_manager.py†L6-L78】
- Added regression coverage for safety manager enforcement, including kill
  switch activation, inaccessible filesystem warnings, and confirmation parsing
  from string payloads.  The new suite raises the governance module’s branch
  coverage over the 85% target for the audit scope.  【F:tests/governance/test_safety_manager.py†L1-L74】

## Findings & Follow-ups
- **Live confirmation regression:** Prior implementation coerced
  `confirm_live` with Python’s `bool()` constructor, meaning any non-empty
  string (including `"false"`) evaluated truthy.  The fix restores the intended
  guardrail.  Recommend adding a governance CLI prompt that echoes the parsed
  confirmation state to operators before executing a live bootstrap to further
  reduce misconfiguration risk.
- **Kill-switch observability:** Enforcement now logs a structured warning when
  filesystem errors prevent kill-switch inspection.  Follow-up recommendation:
  emit a telemetry event so operational dashboards can alert on recurring IO
  failures rather than relying solely on log scraping.

## Validation
- `pytest tests/governance/test_safety_manager.py`
