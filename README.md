# EMP Proving Ground - Evolutionary Market Prediction System

## 🚀 Project Overview

EMP Proving Ground is a **sophisticated mock framework** for architectural validation and strategy development. The system combines:
- **Risk Management Core** - Advanced risk controls and position management
- **PnL Engine** - Real-time profit/loss tracking and analysis
- **5D Sensory Cortex** - Multi-dimensional market intelligence system
- **Evolutionary Decision Trees** - Genetic programming for strategy evolution
- **Adversarial Market Simulation** - Stress testing and validation

## ⚠️ **CURRENT STATUS: MOCK FRAMEWORK - NOT PRODUCTION READY**

**Honest Assessment**: This is a sophisticated architectural framework with excellent modular design, but **currently operates entirely on mock/synthetic data**. Real market integrations are planned but not yet implemented.

### **Capability Matrix**

| **Component** | **Claimed** | **Actual** | **Status** |
|---------------|-------------|------------|------------|
| Market Data | Real-time feeds | Synthetic data only | 🔴 Mock |
| Broker Integration | Live cTrader | Mock interface only | 🔴 Mock |
| Economic Data | FRED API | Placeholder data | 🔴 Mock |
| Sentiment Analysis | News APIs | Synthetic sentiment | 🔴 Mock |
| Order Book | Real-time depth | Generated data | 🔴 Mock |
| Risk Management | Live position tracking | Simulated positions | 🔴 Mock |
| Backtesting | Real historical data | Synthetic scenarios | 🔴 Mock |
| Performance Tracking | Live P&L | Simulated results | 🔴 Mock |

**Legend**: 🔴 Mock | 🟡 Partial | 🟢 Real

## 🛠️ Quick Start

1. **Install Dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Configure System:**
```bash
# Edit configuration files in configs/
# Note: Currently uses mock data sources
```

3. **Run Tests:**
```bash
# Unit tests
python -m pytest tests/unit/

# Integration tests
python -m pytest tests/integration/

# End-to-end tests
python -m pytest tests/end_to_end/

# Reality check (will fail - confirms mock status)
python -m pytest tests/unit/test_reality_check.py
```

4. **Start System:**
```bash
python main.py
# Note: Runs with synthetic data only
```

## 🔧 Configuration

Configuration files are organized in the `configs/` directory:
- `configs/trading/` - Trading platform configurations
- `configs/data/` - Data source configurations
- `configs/system/` - System-wide configurations

**Current Configuration**: All components use mock/synthetic data sources.

## 📊 Current Status
