**Auditor:** Automation (AlphaTrade Roadmap Task)

## Scope

Follow-up sweep of governance safety controls and risk bootstrapping guards to close the Phase II "Policy & Code Audit" checkpoint.
Primary artefacts inspected:

- `src/governance/safety_manager.py`
- `tests/governance/test_safety_manager.py`
- `src/trading/risk/risk_gateway.py`
- `tests/current/test_risk_gateway_validation.py`

## Findings & Resolutions

### 1. Run mode confirmation bypass via uppercase payload (Critical)
- **Observation:** `SafetyManager` stored the `run_mode` string verbatim. Uppercase payloads such as `"LIVE"` bypassed the live confirmation gate because the enforcement check compared against lowercase `"live"`.
- **Resolution:** Normalise run mode inputs during construction and when parsing configuration payloads.
- **Regression Coverage:** Added `test_run_mode_normalisation_blocks_uppercase_live` to assert that uppercase values still trigger the confirmation requirement.

## Additional Verification

- Re-ran the `governance/test_safety_manager.py` suite to ensure the guardrail behaves correctly under the new normalisation.
- Spot-checked risk gateway validation scenarios to confirm no behavioural drift from neighbouring modules.

## Recommendations

- Extend configuration validation to emit structured audit events when manual overrides (e.g. disabling kill-switches) are detected, enabling observability dashboards to flag elevated operational risk.
- Schedule an async-focused audit on the risk gateway's liquidity probe callbacks in Phase III to confirm no race conditions exist under high-frequency order bursts.
