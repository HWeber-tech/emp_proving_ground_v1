# Sprint briefs

Sprint briefs translate the roadmap and alignment briefs into two-week execution
templates. Each brief:

- cites the concept blueprint and roadmap gap table driving the work,
- captures the current-state signals proving the gap still exists, and
- slices the sprint into reviewable tickets with validation hooks.

Maintain these briefs alongside their parent alignment brief so planners and
reviewers inherit the same context pack.
