# Risk & Governance Phase II Code Audit â€“ Closeout Summary

**Date:** 2025-03-06  
**Auditor:** Engineering Maintenance Pod

## Scope

- Trading risk telemetry surface (`src/trading/risk/risk_interface_telemetry.py`).
- Governance-facing event propagation for risk interface failures.
- Regression coverage health for newly stabilised telemetry helpers.

## Findings

1. **Telemetry snapshots lacked regression coverage.**
   - Risk: Interfaces emitting incomplete payloads could silently degrade governance dashboards.
   - Action: Added `tests/trading/test_risk_interface_telemetry.py` to validate snapshot serialisation, Markdown rendering, and event bus integration, ensuring governance reviewers receive complete policy-limit context.

2. **Error alerts required deterministic Markdown formatting.**
   - Risk: Missing detail rows hindered incident triage during Phase II rehearsals.
   - Action: Tests now assert formatted output includes reason codes, preventing regressions in alert readability.

3. **Event bus contracts now exercised in isolation.**
   - Risk: Without isolated coverage, refactors could break telemetry publishing semantics before end-to-end smoke tests caught the regression.
   - Action: Stubbed event bus verifies event type, source tagging, and Markdown attachments for both success and error telemetry flows.

## Follow-ups

- No critical defects remain. Continue Phase III readiness workstreams.
- Retain close monitoring of telemetry payload schema as governance dashboards evolve.

## Evidence

- Regression suite: `tests/trading/test_risk_interface_telemetry.py`
- Module under audit: `src/trading/risk/risk_interface_telemetry.py`
