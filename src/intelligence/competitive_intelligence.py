"""Public fa√ßade for EMP competitive intelligence components.

The module narrows the legacy shim surface down to stable re-exports of the
canonical implementations that live under
``src.thinking.competitive.competitive_intelligence_system``.  External
callers can continue importing from ``src.intelligence.competitive_intelligence``
while internal code should depend on the canonical module directly.
