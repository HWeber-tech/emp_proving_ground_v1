This directory contains deprecated evidence from the pre-FIX era. The active runtime still operates in mock/paper modes onlyâ€”no live trading connectors or authenticated sessions are enabled.

## Contents
- `log.txt`: retained install log from legacy CI bootstrap; superseded by reproducible tooling docs.
- `legacy/`: historical OpenAPI and cTrader notes, microstructure verification drafts, and the v4 reality check report. These references describe workflows that no longer match the current FIX-first design.

Keep these files for historical context only. When refreshing documentation, rebuild guidance against the canonical mock/paper pathways or newly approved production runbooks.
