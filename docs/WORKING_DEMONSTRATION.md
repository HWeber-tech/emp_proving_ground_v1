# Working Demonstration (Legacy OpenAPI)

The previous demonstration documented an end-to-end run of the OpenAPI
microstructure verifier. Because the project no longer supports that
connectivity path, the walkthrough has been removed.

Modern demonstrations should reference the FIX-focused tooling. Start with the
checklists in `docs/fix_api/` and the FIX verification scripts under `scripts/`.
