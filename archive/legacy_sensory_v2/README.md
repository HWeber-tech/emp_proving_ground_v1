# Legacy Sensory System v2 - Archived Files

This directory contains legacy files from the previous sensory system that have been superseded by the enhanced multidimensional market intelligence system.

## Archived Files

### Dimensions/
- `anomaly_dimension.py` - Original anomaly detection (superseded by `enhanced_anomaly_dimension.py`)
- `how_dimension.py` - Original institutional mechanics (superseded by `enhanced_how_dimension.py`)
- `what_dimension.py` - Original technical analysis (superseded by `enhanced_what_dimension.py`)
- `when_dimension.py` - Original temporal analysis (superseded by `enhanced_when_dimension.py`)

### Orchestration/
- `intelligence_engine.py` - Original intelligence engine (superseded by `enhanced_intelligence_engine.py`)

### Examples/
- `demo.py` - Original demo file (superseded by `complete_demo.py`)

## Current System

The current system uses the enhanced versions with:
- Advanced ICT pattern detection
- Sophisticated chaos theory analysis
- Cross-dimensional correlation analysis
- Adaptive weight management
- Self-refutation engines
- Contextual fusion capabilities

## Migration Notes

- All enhanced files are in the main `src/sensory/` directory
- The enhanced system provides superior functionality and performance
- Legacy files are kept for reference but should not be used in production
