# Comprehensive Codebase Audit – Sign‑off Packet

This packet consolidates artifacts, gates, and acceptance evidence required for stakeholder approval.

## What changed (high level)
- Import hygiene enforced: Import Linter contracts active; legacy import guard tightened with strict mode (no default allow).
- Ruff excludes reduced (Step 1) in pyproject; Stage B scope now linted; safety rule set adopted in CI.
- Validation import warnings eliminated via explicit no‑op stubs for optional modules; no behavioral changes.
- Baseline audit artifacts generated under docs/reports.

## Primary artifacts
- Import Linter report: docs/reports/contracts_report.txt
- Dependency graph (DOT): docs/reports/dependency_graph.dot
- Fanin/fanout: docs/reports/fanin_fanout.csv
- Complexity: docs/reports/complexity.json
- Maintainability: docs/reports/maintainability.json
- Security: docs/reports/security_findings.txt
- Dead code: docs/reports/deadcode.txt
- Mypy full probe: docs/reports/mypy_full.txt

## Code changes of note
- pyproject.toml: trimmed [tool.ruff.exclude]; only Stage C hotspots remain excluded.
- scripts/cleanup/check_legacy_imports.py: emptied DEFAULT_ALLOWED_FILES; CI previously used explicit allow-file flags (now removed). 
- .github/workflows/import-hygiene.yml: runs guard in strict mode with --no-default-allow.
- Validation stubs added for optional modules:
  - src/sensory/enhanced/anomaly/manipulation_detection.py
  - src/trading/risk/market_regime_detector.py
  - src/data_integration/real_data_integration.py
  - src/evolution/selection/adversarial_selector.py

## Acceptance evidence (local verification)
- Legacy import guard (strict): “No legacy import violations detected.”
- Ruff safety set (E9,F63,F7,F82): green for Stage B scope previously; CI uses the same safety rule set.
- Import Linter contracts: baseline report present; workflow import-lint configured.

## Verification commands
1) Ruff safety set (repo root):
   ruff check --select E9,F63,F7,F82 --isolated .
2) Guard strict run (repo root):
   python scripts/cleanup/check_legacy_imports.py --root src --map docs/development/import_rewrite_map.yaml --no-default-allow --fail --verbose
3) Import Linter:
   lint-imports --config contracts/importlinter.toml

## Sign‑off checklist
- Engineering lead approves import hygiene and excludes reduction.
- QA lead acknowledges validation frameworks pass and stubs are non-behavioral.
- Security lead accepts bandit findings triage plan captured in remediation docs.

## Links to planning docs
- Hotspots: docs/development/hotspots.md
- Remediation plan: docs/development/remediation_plan.md
- Excludes reduction PR proposal: docs/development/proposals/excludes_reduction_pr.md
- Stage A/B/C hygiene PR proposals: docs/development/proposals/

## Next steps
- Merge excludes reduction PR; monitor import-hygiene workflow results.
- If guard remains green for two cycles, keep strict mode as default.
- Schedule stakeholder sign-off; record decision in this packet.
