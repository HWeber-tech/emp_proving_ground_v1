# EMP Proving Ground v1 - Development Status

## Current Reality Assessment

This document provides an honest assessment of the current development state of the EMP Proving Ground algorithmic trading system.

### System Status: **Development Framework with Production-Calibre FIX Simulator**

⚠️ **Important**: The codebase remains a development framework. It now ships with a rich mock FIX environment and bridging layer for regression work, but there is **no live-trading capability** and the majority of strategy, risk, and evolution modules remain skeletal.

## Component Status

### ✅ Well Exercised Modules

- **Mock FIX stack** – `_MockTradeConnection` and `MockFIXManager` simulate market data, configurable execution plans, identifier sequencing, telemetry, and manual lifecycle control for scripted orders, giving downstream components stable snapshots of enriched execution metadata.【F:src/operational/mock_fix.py†L495-L756】【F:src/operational/mock_fix.py†L2630-L2880】 Regression tests assert the emitted order info, telemetry, history snapshots, and identifier behaviour.【F:tests/current/test_mock_fix.py†L17-L159】
- **FIX connection bridge** – `FIXConnectionManager` picks the mock by default when credentials are absent, adapts callbacks into asyncio queues, and re-encodes execution metadata into FIX-style tag dictionaries for consumers expecting real sessions.【F:src/operational/fix_connection_manager.py†L162-L360】 Lifecycle and smoke tests validate rejects, cancels, ratio plans, metadata overrides, and mock-driven fills traversing the bridge.【F:tests/current/test_fix_lifecycle.py†L47-L199】【F:tests/current/test_fix_smoke.py†L17-L144】
- **Failure harness** – Dedicated tests cover error paths such as failed mock start-up and initiator misconfiguration, ensuring defensive logging and safe fallbacks.【F:tests/current/test_fix_manager_failures.py†L15-L46】

### 🚧 Framework-Only Modules

- **Evolution / intelligence** – Core orchestration still leans on scaffolding (e.g., episodic memory remains a stub), but multi-objective search (`NSGA2`) and institutional guard rails (`EvolutionSafetyController`) are now implemented even though they are not yet wired into end-to-end adaptive runs.【F:src/evolution/episodic_memory_system.py†L4-L11】【F:src/evolution/algorithms/nsga2.py†L1-L334】【F:src/evolution/safety/controls.py†L1-L260】
- **Execution & strategy layers** – Legacy classes like `FIXExecutor` still simulate behaviour with logging rather than integrating with the new FIX stack, signalling pending refactors for real order routing.【F:src/trading/execution/fix_executor.py†L51-L244】
- **Monitoring utilities** – Some operational helpers (e.g. parity checker) provide thin wrappers around metrics sinks without broker integrations, highlighting that live parity reconciliation is unfinished.【F:src/trading/monitoring/parity_checker.py†L27-L129】

### 🛠️ Areas Not Yet Implemented

- No production market data ingestion beyond the simulator.
- No validated trading strategies, risk sizing, or portfolio management loops.
- Research components (genetic evolution, intelligence) retain large architectural gaps despite the new NSGA-II primitive and safety enforcement layer.

## Test Coverage Snapshot

- Regression suites target the FIX simulator and bridge, covering rejects, cancels, partials, fills, metadata overrides, ratio plans, and configuration defaults.【F:tests/current/test_fix_lifecycle.py†L47-L199】【F:tests/current/test_fix_smoke.py†L17-L144】【F:tests/current/test_mock_fix.py†L17-L159】
- Failure tests assert graceful degradation when the simulator cannot start or when no trade connection exists.【F:tests/current/test_fix_manager_failures.py†L15-L46】
- Broader strategy/risk domains have little or no automated coverage yet.

## Next Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation Reality
- Replace mock implementations with real integrations (market data, execution routing).
- Implement actual genetic algorithms and intelligence loops.
- Establish concrete risk sizing and portfolio management pipelines.

### Phase 2: Production Hardening
- Expand automated coverage across strategy/risk modules.
- Address performance, resilience, and operational observability gaps.
- Add security reviews and secrets handling for live credentials.

### Phase 3: Trading Implementation
- Develop, backtest, and paper-trade real strategies.
- Validate broker integrations against live/uat venues.
- Prepare deployment and runbook assets for controlled production trials.

## Development Timeline

**Current Phase**: Framework Development  
**Estimated to Phase 1**: 8-12 weeks  
**Estimated to Production**: 6-12 months  

## Transparency Commitment

This project maintains a truth-first approach to development status reporting. All claims are verified against actual code implementation, and mock components are clearly identified and documented.

## For Developers

When contributing to this project:
1. Clearly distinguish between framework code and functional implementations
2. Mark mock implementations explicitly
3. Update this status document when transitioning components from mock to real
4. Maintain the truth-first development philosophy
