## Overview

The EMP Proving Ground is an **advanced algorithmic trading framework** that combines evolutionary intelligence, multi-dimensional market perception, and institutional-grade risk management. The system is designed to evolve trading strategies through genetic algorithms while maintaining rigorous governance and operational controls.

**Current Status:** Development Framework with Substantial Implementations

The codebase represents a sophisticated architecture with many functional subsystems, but it is **not yet production-ready** for live trading. This README provides an honest assessment of what works, what's in progress, and what remains to be built.

### Project Statistics

- **Source Code:** 662 Python files, 202,140 lines
- **Test Coverage:** 542 test files, 95,958 lines
- **Architecture:** 36 major subsystems across 5 layers
- **Documentation:** 209 markdown files, comprehensive technical specifications

---

## Philosophy

The EMP system embodies three core principles:

1. **Antifragile Design** - Systems that gain strength from volatility and market stress, not just survive them
2. **Evolutionary Intelligence** - Strategies that evolve through genetic algorithms and continuous learning
3. **Multi-Dimensional Perception** - Market analysis across fundamental (WHY), institutional (HOW), technical (WHAT), temporal (WHEN), and anomaly dimensions

The project follows a **truth-first development philosophy**: all claims are backed by verifiable code, realistic timelines acknowledge actual constraints, and documentation honestly reflects implementation status.

---

## Architecture

The system follows a five-layer architecture with clear separation of concerns:

## What's Missing

### ❌ Critical Gaps

These features are **required for production deployment** but not yet implemented:

1. **Real-Time Data Streaming**
   - No WebSocket or FIX market data feeds
   - Currently limited to historical daily data from Yahoo Finance
   - **Impact**: Cannot trade live markets without real-time data

2. **LOBSTER Dataset Integration**
   - No order book data parser or adapter
   - Framework exists (`order_book_analytics.py`) but no data source
   - **Impact**: Cannot train on high-frequency order book data as intended

3. **Comprehensive Backtesting**
   - No historical replay engine
   - Paper trading exists but not systematic backtest framework
   - **Impact**: Cannot validate strategies before live deployment

4. **Automated ML Training Pipeline**
   - Learning components exist but no automated retraining
   - Manual intervention required for model updates
   - **Impact**: Cannot achieve fully autonomous operation

5. **OpenBloomberg / Alternative Data**
   - No Bloomberg-equivalent data integration
   - No fundamental data sources (earnings, financials, economics)
   - **Impact**: WHY dimension is architecturally present but data-limited

### 🔧 Enhancement Opportunities

These features would **improve functionality** but are not blocking:

1. **Instrument Translation Protocol**
   - Current: Basic symbol mapping
   - Needed: Universal instrument representation across asset classes

2. **Advanced Evolutionary Algorithms**
   - Current: Parameter tuning
   - Needed: Full strategy discovery and multi-objective optimization

3. **Mamba-3 Backbone**
   - Current: Named stub with identity forward pass
   - Needed: Full state-space model implementation

4. **Regulatory Reporting**
   - Current: Audit trails and decision diary
   - Needed: Formatted compliance reports

## Key Components Reference

### Risk Management
```python
from src.risk.risk_manager_impl import RiskManagerImpl

# Initialize risk manager with policy
risk_manager = RiskManagerImpl(config=risk_config)

# Validate trade intent
decision = await risk_manager.validate_trade_intent(
    intent=trade_intent,
    portfolio_state=current_portfolio
)
```

### Sentient Learning
```python
from src.sentient.sentient_predator import SentientPredator

# Initialize learning loop
predator = SentientPredator(
    memory=faiss_memory,
    planner=muzero_planner,
    config=sentient_config
)

# Learn from trade outcome
await predator.learn_from_outcome(
    trade_outcome=outcome,
    market_state=state
)
```

### Execution
```python
from src.trading.execution.live_broker_adapter import LiveBrokerExecutionAdapter

# Initialize live broker with risk gating
broker = LiveBrokerExecutionAdapter(
    risk_gateway=risk_manager,
    config=broker_config
)

# Execute trade with full risk checks
order = await broker.process_order(
    intent=trade_intent,
    guardrails=guardrail_snapshot
)
```

---

## Testing Philosophy

The project maintains high testing standards with multiple test categories:

- **Unit Tests**: Component-level validation (`tests/*/test_*.py`)
- **Integration Tests**: Cross-component workflows (`tests/integration/`)
- **Regression Tests**: Prevent known issues from recurring
- **Guardrail Tests**: Verify risk and policy enforcement
- **Evidence Tests**: Reproduce claims from whitepapers

All major features include test coverage with assertions on behavior, not just structure.

---

## Contributing

We welcome contributions that align with the project's truth-first philosophy:

1. **Evidence-Based Development**: All features must include tests
2. **Documentation Accuracy**: Update docs to match implementation reality
3. **Incremental Progress**: Small, verifiable improvements over large claims
4. **Code Quality**: Follow Black formatting, mypy type checking, and pytest standards

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](docs/development/contributing.md) for detailed guidelines.

## Known Issues and Limitations

### Current Limitations

1. **Data Sources**: Limited to Yahoo Finance historical data; no real-time feeds
2. **Strategy Library**: Few concrete strategies implemented
3. **Backtesting**: No systematic historical replay framework
4. **Evolution**: Parameter tuning only; not full strategy discovery
5. **Monitoring**: Governance dashboard exists; full production stack pending

### Deprecated Components

The following directories contain legacy code and should not be used:

- `archive/legacy/`: Old implementations superseded by current architecture
