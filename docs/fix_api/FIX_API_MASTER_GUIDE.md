## 🚨 **TROUBLESHOOTING FRAMEWORK**

### Systematic Diagnosis Approach

**Step 1: Symptom Identification**
Classify the issue into one of these categories:
- Connection failures (cannot establish network connection)
- Authentication failures (connection established but logon rejected)
- Market data issues (no data received or malformed data)
- Order execution problems (orders rejected or not executed)
- Message format errors (protocol violations or parsing failures)

**Step 2: Root Cause Analysis**
For each symptom category, follow the diagnostic tree:
- Verify configuration against known working values
- Check network connectivity and SSL configuration
- Validate message formats and protocol compliance
- Review server responses and error messages
- Analyze logs for patterns and anomalies

**Step 3: Solution Implementation**
Apply appropriate fixes based on root cause:
- Configuration corrections for parameter mismatches
- Network or SSL configuration adjustments
- Message format corrections for protocol violations
- Credential or permission updates with IC Markets
- Code fixes for logic or implementation errors

### Common Issue Resolution

**Authentication Failures**
Most common causes and solutions:
- Incorrect SenderCompID format (must be demo.icmarkets.{ACCOUNT})
- Wrong TargetSubID for session type (QUOTE for price, TRADE for trade)
- Invalid credentials (verify FIX API password, not trading password)
- Sequence number issues (ensure starting from 1 with reset flag)

**Market Data Problems**
Typical issues and resolutions:
- Using text symbols instead of numeric IDs (use 1 for EURUSD)
- Missing NoRelatedSym field in MarketDataRequest
- Wrong session type (must use price session with QUOTE SubIDs)
- Symbol availability (verify symbol is available for market data)

**Order Execution Issues**
Common problems and fixes:
- Trading not enabled on account (contact IC Markets support)
- Using price session instead of trade session
- Invalid order parameters (quantity, symbol, order type)
- Insufficient account permissions or balance

### Emergency Recovery Procedures

**Complete System Reset**
When all else fails, follow this recovery sequence:
1. Stop all FIX connections and clear session state
2. Reset configuration to last known working state
3. Test with minimal functionality (authentication only)
4. Gradually add features (market data, then orders)
5. Document any new issues discovered during recovery

**Fallback Configuration**
Use this emergency configuration for basic functionality:
- Host: demo-uk-eqx-01.p.c-trader.com
- Ports: 5211 (price), 5212 (trade)
- Sessions: QUOTE/QUOTE for price, TRADE/TRADE for trade
- Symbol: 1 (EURUSD only)
- SSL verification disabled for testing

## ✅ **TESTING AND VALIDATION PROCEDURES**

### Comprehensive Test Strategy

**Truth-First Validation Philosophy**
All testing must demonstrate real functionality:
- No mock responses or simulated success
- All tests performed against live IC Markets demo servers
- Evidence required for every claim of functionality
- Independent reproducibility by different operators

**Multi-Level Testing Approach**
Implement testing at multiple levels:
- Unit tests for individual components and functions
- Integration tests for end-to-end protocol flows
- Acceptance tests for business scenario validation
- Regression tests to prevent functionality degradation

### Critical Test Scenarios

**Authentication Validation**
Verify authentication works correctly:
- Successful logon to both price and trade sessions
- Proper handling of authentication failures
- Session persistence and heartbeat management
- Graceful handling of session disconnections

**Market Data Validation**
Confirm market data functionality:
- Successful subscription to Symbol 1 (EURUSD)
- Reception of market data snapshots and updates
- Proper parsing and processing of market data messages
- Handling of subscription errors and rejections

**Order Execution Validation**
Validate order processing capability:
- Successful placement of market orders
- Reception of ExecutionReport messages
- Proper order status tracking and management
- Verification of orders in IC Markets account

### Performance and Reliability Testing

**Latency Measurement**
Measure and validate system performance:
- Order placement to ExecutionReport latency (target: <2 seconds average)
- Market data update processing time
- Authentication and session establishment time
- Recovery time from network interruptions

**Stability Testing**
Verify long-term system stability:
- Extended operation without memory leaks
- Consistent performance over time
- Proper handling of various error conditions
