# Summary
- _Bullets summarising the change set. Keep them implementation-focused and reference modules/files._

## Concept alignment
- **Concept excerpt:** _Quote or link the relevant section of `EMP_ENCYCLOPEDIA_v2.3_CANONICAL.md` or another concept artefact that promises the capability you are touching._
- **Reality gap:** _Link the code/tests/logs that demonstrate the current shortfall._
- **Alignment brief / roadmap item:** _Reference the brief and roadmap bullet this PR advances (e.g. `docs/context/alignment_briefs/institutional_data_backbone.md`, `docs/roadmap.md#30-day-outcomes`)._

## Implementation notes
- _Call out architectural decisions, feature flags, migrations, and how this change threads through the tiered runtimes._
- _Document any telemetry, alerting, or runbook updates made (or still pending)._ 

## Validation
- _List the commands, notebooks, or dashboards that validate this work (pytest, mypy, notebooks, manual drills, etc.). Include direct output or links._
- _Capture ingest freshness/latency metrics or other SLO signals if they moved._

## Rollout & follow-up
- _Detail rollout sequencing, feature-flag toggles, coordination needed with other streams, and explicit follow-up issues to open._

## Reviewer checklist
- [ ] Concept excerpt quoted/linked and the gap statement is concrete.
- [ ] Validation evidence attached (tests, notebooks, telemetry screenshots/logs).
- [ ] Observability / runbook impact noted.
- [ ] Follow-up tickets filed (or confirmed unnecessary).
