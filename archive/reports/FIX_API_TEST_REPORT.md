## ⚠️ Issues Identified

### 1. SimpleFIX Library Usage Error

**Issue:** `FixParser.get_message() takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given`

**Location:** `src/operational/icmarkets_simplefix_application.py`

**Root Cause:** Incorrect API usage in response parsing
```python
# Current (broken):
response_msg = simplefix.FixParser().get_message(response.decode())

# Should be:
parser = simplefix.FixParser()
parser.append_buffer(response)
response_msg = parser.get_message()
```

**Impact:** Prevents SimpleFIX application from processing server responses

**Priority:** HIGH - Blocks full application functionality

### 2. Main Application Integration Error

**Issue:** `'FIXApplication' object has no attribute 'set_message_queue'`

**Location:** `main.py` line attempting to call `fix_app.set_message_queue()`

**Root Cause:** Missing method in FIXApplication class

**Impact:** Prevents main application startup

**Priority:** MEDIUM - Workaround available via direct SimpleFIX usage

### 3. Test Result Logic Error

**Issue:** Test shows "All tests passed" even when connections fail

**Location:** `scripts/test_simplefix.py`

**Root Cause:** Incorrect success/failure logic in test reporting

**Impact:** False positive test results

**Priority:** LOW - Doesn't affect functionality, only reporting
