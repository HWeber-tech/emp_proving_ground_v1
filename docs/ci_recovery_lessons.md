# CI Recovery Brownbag & Lessons Learned

## Session Overview
- **Format:** Async brownbag write-up shared with engineering and platform squads.
- **Objective:** Document key takeaways from the CI mypy recovery effort and set expectations for ongoing maintenance.
- **Audience:** Service owners, feature teams, and release engineering.

## Agenda & Talking Points
1. **Containment Recap**
   - Highlighted the interim policy that kept CI green while surfacing mypy output through scoped jobs and nightly artifacts.
   - Demonstrated how the strict-on-touch helper prevented regressions on new code paths.
2. **Remediation Patterns That Worked**
   - Shared coercion utilities (`coerce_int`, `coerce_float`) and mapping normalisation helpers to address unsafe numeric conversions and heterogenous telemetry payloads.
   - Reviewed the value of targeted stubs (Redis, confluent-kafka) and protocol hardening for async task factories.
   - Encouraged reusing structured metadata containers (TypedDicts, dataclasses) instead of raw `dict[str, object]` mutations.
3. **Documentation & Automation**
   - Pointed to the conventions guide, remediation playbooks, and backlog inventory as living references.
   - Highlighted the reinstated CI types job, nightly strict run, and pre-push hooks as safety rails.
4. **Open Questions & Next Steps**
   - Evaluate repository-wide strict defaults (`disallow_untyped_defs`) once the next tranche of modules stabilises.
   - Track weekly error deltas and publish summaries in the backlog inventory log.
   - Encourage teams to register new dependency stubs early in the development cycle.

## Action Items for Attendees
- Review owned modules against the conventions guide and adopt the shared helpers.
- Ensure pre-commit hooks are installed locally (`pre-commit install && pre-commit install --hook-type pre-push`).
- Surface any missing stubs or protocol gaps through the platform backlog so we can prioritise upstream fixes.
- Add mypy regression checks to team-specific dashboards (where applicable) using the nightly artifact.
