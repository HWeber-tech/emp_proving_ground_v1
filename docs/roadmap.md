AlphaTrade Gap Analysis and Roadmap
Gap Analysis Report

This section compares the current emp_proving_ground_v1 codebase against the envisioned AlphaTrade architecture. The AlphaTrade blueprint organizes the system into five major components – Perception, Adaptation, Reflection, Risk/Execution, and Governance – each corresponding to a stage in the intelligent trading loop. Below, we identify for each component what is already implemented, what is partially in place, what is missing, and any misalignments between the blueprint and the current implementation.

Perception (Sensory Ingest & Belief Formation)

Implemented: The code establishes a layered perception pipeline that ingests sensory data (market signals) into an internal belief state. A BeliefState model is in place to represent posterior beliefs and regime context, including Hebbian-style updates to capture recent patterns
GitHub
. A sensory cortex framework exists with a “real_sensory_organ” module that fuses multiple signal types (WHAT/WHEN/WHY/HOW/ANOMALY) into unified sensory payloads
GitHub
. The belief/regime scaffolding is functional: it buffers sensor inputs, emits finite-state regime indicators, and enforces positive semi-definite (PSD) covariance updates as a stability check
GitHub
. Core architecture for perception reflects the encyclopedia’s layered design (core → sensory → thinking…)
GitHub
.

Partially Implemented: Many sensory inputs are still mock or synthetic. The real-time data ingest is not fully wired – currently relying on placeholders rather than live market feeds
GitHub
GitHub
. Key sensory “organs” (e.g. HOW and ANOMALY detectors) exist only as stubs or thin heuristics with NotImplementedError in places
GitHub
. Lineage and telemetry for sensory signals have been started (ensuring each data point carries source metadata), but the system still feeds on sample or generated data until a real data backbone is delivered. Drift detection is present (the Drift Sentry monitors statistical drift in beliefs) but depends on synthetic data and has not been exercised on real streaming input
GitHub
.

Missing: A production-grade data backbone for perception is absent – there are no live connections to TimescaleDB, Redis, or Kafka yet
GitHub
. The system needs actual market data ingest (e.g. price feeds, order book updates) feeding the sensory organ. Robust anomaly detection (the ANOMALY organ) and explanatory diagnostics (the WHY organ) are not implemented beyond basic placeholders
GitHub
. Also missing is the continuous calibration of sensors: e.g. adjusting to new instrument data, handling missing data, etc. Without these, the perception layer cannot fully reflect the blueprint’s vision of a rich sensory cortex driving the loop.

Misalignments: The AlphaTrade vision calls for a rich, real-time sensory cortex with multiple specialized detectors and trustworthy signals; currently, the code’s perception layer is conceptually aligned but functionally limited to scaffolding
GitHub
. In particular, the blueprint’s emphasis on executable organs and fused signals is only partially realized – the code structure is there, but actual data quality, validation, and anomaly logic are lacking. This means the spirit of Perception (delivering reliable, validated market facts to downstream components) isn’t yet met in practice. The design itself is sound (no major structural misalignment), but the implementation is incomplete, leaving a gap to close before Perception can fully anchor the loop.

Adaptation (Policy Routing & Fast-Weight Learning)

Implemented: The code implements an Understanding Router and a Policy Router that together realize the Adaptation stage of AlphaTrade. The UnderstandingRouter ingests belief snapshots and routes them to a chosen strategy/tactic, functioning as the decision-making “brain” that selects an action or intent
GitHub
GitHub
. Crucially, fast-weight adaptation is integrated: the router supports Hebbian fast-weight updates – short-term adjustments to strategy preferences based on recent evidence
GitHub
. This means the system can amplify or dampen certain tactics dynamically (“neurons that fire together wire together”), consistent with the BDH-inspired fast-weight principle. The PolicyRouter in the thinking layer tracks strategy metadata (objectives, tags) and manages experiment lifecycles, allowing new tactics to be registered and providing reflection data on their performance
GitHub
GitHub
. The overall Adaptation loop (Perception → Adaptation → Reflection) is coded in the AlphaTradeLoopOrchestrator, which ties router decisions to drift checks and governance gating
GitHub
GitHub
. In summary, the adaptive decision-making framework – including configurable strategy routing and fast-weight toggles – is present and anchoring the system’s logic.

Partially Implemented: While the routing and fast-weight mechanics exist, the broader Evolution Engine (adaptive intelligence that generates or mutates strategies) remains mostly scaffolding. The alignment plan envisioned an “institutional genome catalogue” and pipeline for evolving new strategies
GitHub
, but in code this is limited. The current adaptation relies on predefined strategies and simple heuristic adjustments. There are placeholders for evolutionary pipelines and integration with a strategy catalogue, but these are not fully fleshed out (many “adaptive population” features are toggled off or produce no-ops)
GitHub
. Fast-weight experiments are implemented behind a feature flag that requires governance approval
GitHub
, indicating that adaptive learning is not yet default. Additionally, the fast-weight updates currently apply a simple decay and boost to strategy weights; more complex behaviors (e.g. long-term learning or meta-learning) are not yet realized. Sparse positive activation – a key BDH principle where neurons have high-dimensional positive activations – is not explicitly enforced, although the groundwork (non-negative weight updates via Hebbian logic) is laid. In short, the adaptation layer has the basic fast-weight loop but is not yet the full intelligent, self-evolving system described in the blueprint.

Missing: The “Evolution Engine” is largely missing in practice. The system has no mechanism to create entirely new strategies or significantly alter algorithms based on performance – there is no genetic algorithm or gradient descent updating the strategy set. Also absent is the integration with a strategy catalogue or repository: e.g. selecting from a library of tactics or logging new variants into that library for future use
GitHub
. Advanced adaptation features like long-term memory of successful patterns, or automatic hyperparameter tuning of strategies over time, are not implemented. Moreover, the blueprint’s notion of adaptation includes mutating against real data feeds
GitHub
 – since real feeds aren’t hooked up yet (Perception gap), the adaptation cannot truly learn from live market behavior. Sparse positive activations (ensuring that only a small fraction of strategy “neurons” activate at a time, and that activations are non-negative) are not enforced by any module – this could be a design adjustment needed to align with BDH theory. In essence, the system does not yet learn new trading tactics or significantly improve existing ones on its own; it can only tweak weightings of pre-programmed tactics.

Misalignments: Conceptually, the code aligns with the blueprint’s Adaptation loop – it has a router with fast-weight updates and the idea of evolving strategy preferences. However, there is a gap between the aspirational adaptive behavior (a rich evolution of strategies) and the current simplistic implementation. The BDH-inspired elements (fast weights) are present, but others (sparse activations, graph-based reasoning dynamics) are not explicitly present beyond basic data structures. The blueprint expects Adaptation to be highly dynamic and data-driven, whereas the current state is rule-based and limited. No fundamental architecture changes are needed (the scaffolding is in place), but significant development is required to realize the blueprint’s vision of an autonomous, learning “evolution engine” driving this component
GitHub
.

Reflection (Decision Diaries & Learning Feedback)

Implemented: The system includes a Reflection stage that records decisions and generates insights from them. A Decision Diary mechanism is implemented – every AlphaTrade loop iteration produces a DecisionDiaryEntry that logs the context, chosen strategy, outcomes, and reasoning notes
GitHub
GitHub
. These diaries are persisted via a DecisionDiaryStore and serve as an auditable trail of “why was this decision made.” The code also provides a PolicyReflectionBuilder which compiles recent decision records into Reflection Artifacts
GitHub
GitHub
. These artifacts summarize emerging tactics, their performance, first/last seen times, and any gating (e.g. if a strategy was forced to paper trading)
GitHub
. In effect, the system can produce a reflection digest for reviewers or automated analysis, so that over a window of time one can see which strategies are gaining or losing favor and why. There’s also a graph diagnostics tool that visualizes the understanding loop (sensory → belief → router → policy) as a DAG, helping reflect on the decision pipeline structure
GitHub
. The presence of these features means the Reflection component – capturing experience and providing data for learning – is acknowledged in the codebase and partially functional. The blueprint’s intent for an auditable reasoning loop is met at least to the extent that every decision is transparently recorded with metadata
GitHub
.

Partially Implemented: The diaries and reflection summaries exist, but using them for learning feedback is limited. Currently, reflection artifacts are primarily for human governance review (e.g. seeing evidence for strategy promotions) rather than automatically adjusting the system. The fast-weight adaptation loop does not yet incorporate long-term feedback from the diaries – e.g. there is no mechanism like “if a strategy consistently underperforms as seen in diaries, automatically downweight or remove it.” Instead, such adjustments would still be manual (via governance CLI). Some aspects of reflection that the blueprint envisions, like “sigma stability checkpoints” (monitoring the stability of belief updates over time) and other health metrics, are only partly realized via tests (ensuring covariance matrices remain PSD, etc.)
GitHub
. The system does export performance telemetry (ROI, P&L) for each strategy
GitHub
, which is a form of reflection, but this data is not yet looped back into strategy selection. Interpretability is another partial area: the blueprint highlights interpretability of state and reasoning; the code provides raw data (diaries, graph dumps) but no higher-level analysis like highlighting which “concept synapses” were most active (a nod to BDH’s interpretability). The building blocks for reflection are there, but the feedback loop is not closed – insights are gathered but not yet used to automatically tune the system.

Missing: Automated post-analysis and learning from the decision records are missing. For example, there’s no module performing trend analysis on the diary entries (e.g. detecting that “Strategy A only works in regime X” or “Strategy B’s performance is deteriorating”). The blueprint suggests a system that can reflect and self-correct; currently, any such reflection-driven changes must be done by a developer or analyst examining the logs. Also missing are formal acceptance tests (validation hooks) for the reflection outputs – while there are some tests (ensuring the diary CLI and reflection builder run
GitHub
), the criteria for a “good” reflection (e.g. it correctly identifies new emerging strategies or anomalies in decisions) are not automated. Graph health metrics (e.g. measuring the complexity or sparsity of the decision graph over time) are not gathered, meaning the system isn’t quantifying the health of its reasoning process (the blueprint’s nod to graph dynamics and modularity is not yet instrumented). In summary, Reflection currently records but does not learn; the system lacks an implementation of “reflection as a teacher” to the adaptation process.

Misalignments: The architecture for Reflection is in line with the blueprint – the idea of diaries and reflection artifacts matches the vision of an introspective system. The misalignment lies in purpose and depth: the blueprint (inspired by BDH and similar cognitive architectures) implies that reflection should influence the system’s behavior (closing the loop with adaptation), whereas in the current code reflection is passive (for audit/compliance). Another subtle misalignment is in the metric-driven reflection: the blueprint’s emphasis on metrics like “graph sparsity” or activation patterns for interpretability isn’t yet reflected in the implementation (the code doesn’t ensure activations are sparse positive or measure concept-level activity). Addressing these gaps will bring Reflection from a compliance log towards a true learning mechanism.

Risk/Execution (Risk Management and Trade Execution)

Implemented: The codebase contains foundational elements of risk management and execution control. A DriftSentryGate is implemented to act as a risk gate on execution – it evaluates each proposed trade against drift metrics and confidence thresholds, potentially flipping a force_paper flag to prevent live execution if conditions look anomalous
GitHub
. Risk policies (like leverage and exposure limits) are defined in configurations and there are tests ensuring warnings trigger before limits are breached
GitHub
. An execution release router exists to decide how orders are routed (e.g. to paper trading vs live, based on the drift gate’s decision and policy stage)
GitHub
. The system also includes a portfolio monitor for tracking positions and P&L, albeit in a basic form, and an execution readiness journal that logs whether services (like data feeds or brokers) are up before trading
GitHub
. These show that the scaffolding for execution – the order lifecycle and risk checks – mirrors the encyclopedia’s prescribed order of operations
GitHub
. Additionally, compliance telemetry hooks are present (audit logs, incident response stubs) indicating the system’s awareness of compliance needs. In short, the codebase has risk check structures and toggles to ensure that trades are gated by risk evaluations and that execution can be toggled between simulation and real mode.

Partially Implemented: Actual trade execution is still running on “paper.” The trading and execution modules operate on simulated orders and mock broker interfaces – there is no live broker integration or order routing to markets yet
GitHub
. Risk enforcement is described as “hollow” in assessments
GitHub
: while limits exist on paper, the system doesn’t yet connect to real capital constraints (e.g. it’s not hooked to an account to truly prevent an order). Some risk checks (like those for position sizing or portfolio diversification) may not be fully implemented beyond placeholders. The async task supervision for execution (running order placements in background tasks, ensuring none hang or crash) is only partially migrated – the runtime builder and task supervisor are in progress, meaning execution tasks might still be launched unsupervised in some paths
GitHub
. Compliance monitoring (e.g. checking regulatory rules or logging trade data for compliance) is minimal: there are audit log structures, but no active enforcement beyond risk limits. In summary, the mechanics to simulate trading are there and the safety switches exist, but real execution capabilities and robust risk responses are not yet complete.

Missing: Key pieces missing include production integration for execution – for example, connections to brokerage APIs or trading exchanges are not implemented, so the system cannot place a real order. Also missing is risk-based position sizing: the blueprint expects that given a strategy signal, the system calculates an optimal position size under risk limits, but currently there is “no risk sizing” at all
GitHub
. The institutional risk and compliance layer is incomplete – features like pre-trade compliance checks, post-trade reconciliation, or regulatory audit trail generation are absent. Ops readiness items like stress tests or kill-switches for the trading engine need to be added to match the blueprint’s focus on safety (some incident response hooks exist, but likely not end-to-end). Additionally, the blueprint calls for expanding broker coverage after internal gates are solid
GitHub
, implying that multi-broker or multi-exchange handling is on the roadmap but currently missing. Finally, while the system can force trades to paper mode, a robust policy enforcement that only allows fully approved strategies to execute live is not yet guaranteed (it depends on humans using the CLI to promote stages). In essence, AlphaTrade cannot yet execute a real trade in production with full confidence – the pipeline from decision to execution is incomplete.

Misalignments: The major misalignment is that the current system is still a simulation framework, whereas the AlphaTrade blueprint assumes a trajectory toward a real trading platform with enforceable risk controls. The architecture is on the right track, but practically, capital is not at risk because the system isn’t ready to handle real capital
GitHub
. For instance, the blueprint emphasizes deterministic risk APIs and policy breach telemetry
GitHub
 – the code has placeholders for these, but until actual execution is attempted, it’s unclear how effective they are. There’s also a structural note: risk management in the code has been refactored (old risk modules deprecated in favor of a canonical core risk module)
GitHub
GitHub
, which aligns with the blueprint’s intent to have a single source of truth for risk. However, until the execution layer is fully functional, the risk management can’t be truly battle-tested. In summary, the design largely aligns with the envisioned risk/execution loop (no major redesign needed), but there is a significant gap in implementation maturity.

Governance (Policy Governance & Promotion Process)

Implemented: A robust Governance layer is present to oversee which strategies can trade and under what conditions. The system includes a Policy Ledger (in src/governance) that records each strategy (“policy”) and its approval stage – e.g. experimental, paper-trade, or live
GitHub
GitHub
. The ledger persists promotion history, approvals, threshold overrides, and links to decision diary evidence for each promotion
GitHub
. On top of this, a suite of governance CLI tools is implemented: for example, rebuild_policy to regenerate risk config from the ledger, promote_policy to approve a strategy’s next stage with proper sign-offs, and alpha_trade_graduation to batch-promote strategies that meet all criteria
GitHub
GitHub
. These tools ensure that any strategy going from backtest to paper or paper to live is traceable and auditable. The AlphaTrade loop orchestrator itself uses the ledger: it queries the LedgerReleaseManager to fetch the current release stage and risk thresholds for the chosen policy, and uses that to enforce stage-appropriate gates (for example, ensuring a strategy in “paper” stage cannot execute real trades, by activating the force_paper flag)
GitHub
GitHub
. Overall, the governance processes and data structures described in the blueprint (promotion gates, evidence-backed approvals, deterministic governance metadata on each decision) are present and functioning in the code.

Partially Implemented: The governance features exist, but their integration into day-to-day operations is partial. Enforcement of governance policies relies on the developers/operators running the CLI tools and monitoring outputs – there isn’t a live UI or automated daemon that, for example, halts an unapproved strategy (though the architecture would allow it via the ledger checks). Some governance checks are enforced in code (like requiring a decision diary entry ID when promoting a policy, to ensure evidence is cited
GitHub
), but others may be more procedural (outside the code’s automatic handling). The governance telemetry (dashboards showing how many strategies at each stage, any pending approvals, etc.) is not fully developed – observability panels exist for the understanding loop and drift, but governance info might only be in logs or JSON manifests. Additionally, while the ledger captures threshold overrides per strategy, the system still needs human input to decide those overrides; there’s no AI deciding “this strategy should have tighter risk limits” – governance in that sense is manual. The blueprint’s notion of deterministic promotion gates is implemented at a basic level (stages in ledger), but dynamic policy enforcement (like auto-downgrading a strategy if it triggers too many alerts) is not implemented. In summary, governance is structurally in place but not yet a “hands-off” autonomous module – it provides tools for humans to govern the system.

Missing: A few things are missing to fully realize the governance vision. Real-time governance monitoring – e.g. a continuously running process or dashboard that flags when a strategy is eligible for promotion or needs demotion – is not present. Integration with enterprise governance (approvals via UI, or embedding in a larger workflow system) is beyond the current scope. Also, policy documentation and rationales might need to be auto-generated for each promotion (currently, one must read the diaries and ledger entries manually). The blueprint’s focus on compliance telemetry suggests that every governance action should be visible and testable; while the ledger provides data, the system lacks a user-friendly presentation of compliance status (e.g. “All strategies trading live have passed X criteria”). Another missing piece is Governance of configuration: ensuring any config changes go through similar review (the current ledger is strategy-focused). Finally, as a future feature, one could imagine machine-supported governance (ML suggestions for promotions or flagging anomalies in strategy performance for review) – needless to say, this is not yet implemented. Essentially, the governance is policy-driven but not yet intelligent or fully automated.

Misalignments: The code’s governance approach aligns well with the blueprint’s intent: it provides structured, auditable control over system behavior. There is no major misalignment in design; rather, the misalignment is in maturity – the blueprint likely envisions a seamless promotion pipeline with clear metrics at each gate, whereas currently it’s a set of powerful but developer-operated tools. One area to watch is whether all blueprint governance rules are enforced: for example, the blueprint implies that understanding loop outputs should feed governance decisions (ensuring “AlphaTrade parity work can ship without capital risk” by using live-shadow mode until ready
GitHub
). The current system does enforce a “live-shadow” (paper) mode by default for new strategies via drift gating and ledger stage, which is correct. However, if there are any blueprint policies not coded (such as time-based graduation criteria or multi-approval requirements), those would be gaps. In summary, governance in code is largely faithful to the plan, with the remaining work being operational integration and perhaps adding intelligence to assist human governors.

Summary of Gaps: In all, the emp_proving_ground_v1 codebase has established the core architecture (the five components exist and interact as intended
GitHub
), but most components are only partially realized. Many subsystems still rely on scaffolding or mocks, and several advanced features from the AlphaTrade vision (live data ingestion, adaptive evolution of strategies, automated reflective learning, real trade execution, and fully automated governance oversight) are incomplete or absent. There are few fundamental design misalignments – the gaps are mostly feature-completeness and integration gaps rather than structural flaws. This is a strong position to be in: the blueprint is validated by the current design, and the task ahead is to close the implementation gaps with focused development in each area

90-Day Roadmap (Phased Execution Plan)

Below is a refreshed 90-day roadmap to guide the next phase of AlphaTrade development. This plan is organized into three phases, each roughly one month, aligning with: Phase I – Understanding Loop & Data Backbone, Phase II – Governance & Risk Hardening, and Phase III – Full Integration & “Paper-Ready” System. Each phase is broken down into key milestones with checklist deliverables and measurable acceptance criteria (Definitions of Done). We also include a “Start Now” section for immediate next steps (first 48 hours) to build momentum. Throughout, we incorporate BDH-inspired primitives – specifically fast-weights (already in use), sparse positive activations, and graph health metrics – to ensure the system stays aligned with cutting-edge architectural principles. All new development will adhere to the preferred project directory structure (layered by core/sensory/thinking/trading/governance domains) and maintain strict code contracts (typed interfaces, data model schemas, and regression tests) for clarity and reliability
