# Legacy Sensory System v2 - Archived Files

This directory contains legacy files from the previous sensory system that have been superseded by the enhanced multidimensional market intelligence system.

## Archived Files

### Dimensions/
- `anomaly_dimension.py` - Original anomaly detection (superseded by `enhanced_anomaly_dimension.py`)
- `how_dimension.py` - Original institutional mechanics (superseded by `enhanced_how_dimension.py`)
- `what_dimension.py` - Original technical analysis (superseded by `enhanced_what_dimension.py`)
- `when_dimension.py` - Original temporal analysis (superseded by `enhanced_when_dimension.py`)
- `why_dimension.py` - Original fundamental analysis (superseded by `enhanced_why_dimension.py`)

### Orchestration/
- `intelligence_engine.py` - Original intelligence engine (superseded by `enhanced_intelligence_engine.py`)

### Examples/
- `demo.py` - Original demo file (superseded by `complete_demo.py`)

## Current System

The current system uses the enhanced versions with:
- **Enhanced WHY Dimension**: Advanced fundamental intelligence with economic momentum tracking
- **Enhanced HOW Dimension**: Advanced ICT pattern detection with institutional mechanics
- **Enhanced WHAT Dimension**: Pure price action analysis with technical reality engine
- **Enhanced WHEN Dimension**: Sophisticated temporal intelligence with session dynamics
- **Enhanced ANOMALY Dimension**: Chaos intelligence with self-refutation engines
- **Enhanced Intelligence Engine**: Contextual fusion with cross-dimensional awareness

### Key Enhancements
- Advanced ICT pattern detection
- Sophisticated chaos theory analysis
- Cross-dimensional correlation analysis
- Adaptive weight management
- Self-refutation engines
- Contextual fusion capabilities
- Real data integration (no placeholders)

## Migration Notes

- All enhanced files are in the main `src/sensory/` directory
- The enhanced system provides superior functionality and performance
- Legacy files are kept for reference but should not be used in production
- All placeholders and stubs have been eliminated in the enhanced system

## Date Archived

## Update History
- **Initial Archive**: Moved original dimensional engines and intelligence engine
- **Enhanced WHY Addition**: Added enhanced why dimension and archived legacy version
- **Complete Integration**: All 5 dimensions now have enhanced versions
