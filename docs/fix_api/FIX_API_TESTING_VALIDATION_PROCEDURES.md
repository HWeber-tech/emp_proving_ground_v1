## ðŸŽ¯ **TESTING PHILOSOPHY**

### Truth-First Validation
All testing procedures prioritize **real-world validation** over simulated success. Every test must demonstrate actual functionality with IC Markets servers, not mock responses or simulated data.

### Evidence-Based Verification
- **No Claims Without Proof:** Every assertion must be backed by concrete evidence
- **Independent Validation:** Tests must be reproducible by different operators
- **Real-World Conditions:** All tests performed against live IC Markets demo environment
- **Comprehensive Coverage:** Test all critical paths and failure scenarios
