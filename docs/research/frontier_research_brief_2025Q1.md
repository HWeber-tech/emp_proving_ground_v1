# Frontier Research Brief — 2025 Q1

## Executive Summary

Q1 focused on stabilising the evolution laboratory, enriching sensory telemetry,
and validating roadmap hypotheses drawn from the EMP Encyclopedia.  The moving-
average crossover genetic algorithm outperformed the baseline momentum stack,
while sensory upgrades highlighted gaps in liquidity data coverage.  No critical
risk alerts were triggered, but governance follow-ups are required for sentiment
payload retention.

## Experiment Highlights

| Experiment | Hypothesis Link | Outcome | Key Metrics |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ma_crossover_ga` | Encyclopedia Chapter 18 — Antifragile evolution | ✅ Improved Sharpe to 3.92 vs 2.35 baseline, drawdown held at 1% | Fitness 4.17, Sharpe 3.92, Sortino 5.98, Max DD 1.0% |
| `volatility_breakout_regime` | Chapter 12 — Volatility state-aware execution | ⚠️ Confirmed alpha in high-vol regimes but underperformed in range-bound markets | Win rate 54%, avg trade PnL +0.18%, VaR utilisation 62% |
| `sensor_drift_baseline` | Chapter 7 — Sensor drift resilience | ✅ Drift guards detected synthetic outages within 4 minutes | Drift score threshold 0.85, alert MTTR 6 minutes |
| `risk_guardrail_backtest` | Chapter 20 — Capital preservation | ✅ VaR/ES gates blocked 100% of simulated breaches | Parametric VaR @99% = 1.2%, ES = 1.8% |

## Encyclopedia Alignment

- Evolution experiments validate the antifragile adaptation claims from the
  encyclopedia by demonstrating consistent uplift under stress scenarios.
- Volatility breakout trials surfaced the need for adaptive regime gating,
  directly feeding Phase 2A follow-up stories.
- Sensor drift harness matched Layer 2 telemetry expectations, confirming
  readiness for live-paper monitoring.
- Risk guardrail backtests achieved Tier-0 acceptance criteria and flagged no
  documentation gaps.

## Action Items

1. **Diversity operators** — Prioritise GA speciation (see
   `docs/research/advanced_research_backlog.md`).
2. **Regime adaptation** — Schedule design review for breakout strategy gating
   before promoting to production experiments.
3. **Sentiment governance** — Finalise archival policy for news data prior to
   onboarding vendors.
4. **Data acquisition** — Source high-frequency depth feeds to close the
   liquidity coverage item in the research debt register.

## Next Quarter Focus

- Integrate Pareto-front selection and telemetry upgrades into the GA harness.
- Deliver prototype sentiment ingestion with compliance-approved governance.
- Extend causal inference experiments to stress-test adaptive risk allocation.
- Publish updated encyclopedia cross-references covering new sensory analytics.
