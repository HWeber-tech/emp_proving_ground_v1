# Policy Promotion Governance Runbook

## Purpose

This runbook documents the checks operators must complete before promoting an AlphaTrade policy from experimentation into production tiers. It aligns the policy ledger, DecisionDiary evidence, and compliance approvals so the governance squad inherits a deterministic audit trail.

## Required Evidence

- DecisionDiary entry ID with replay artifacts and narration capsule link
- Approval signatures from risk and compliance (minimum two reviewers)
- Recorded policy delta describing risk configuration and router guardrail changes

## Pre-Promotion Checklist

1. Verify the policy ledger record references the expected DecisionDiary evidence ID
2. Confirm risk and compliance approvals are recorded and match the decision review
3. Review the policy delta for completeness and ensure guardrail overrides are justified
4. Validate regenerated risk configuration via `tools/governance/rebuild_policy.py`
5. Update the observability dashboard tile with the latest ledger and drift posture

## Escalation Path

- Missing diary evidence: escalate to the Understanding Loop lead and halt promotion
- Incomplete approvals: notify the governance squad and return the policy to paper trading
- Unexpected risk deltas: trigger the risk API runbook and engage the risk engineering team

## Post-Promotion Actions

- Publish the Markdown changelog generated by `rebuild_policy.py --changelog`
- Archive the governance checklist snapshot in the compliance readiness report
- Schedule a follow-up review to confirm DriftSentry metrics remain within thresholds
