# Policy & Code Audit â€“ Phase II Completion

## Scope
- Governance audit logging (`src/governance/audit_logger.py`)
- Risk posture orchestration (`src/risk/risk_manager_impl.py`)
- Associated pytest suites under `tests/governance` and `tests/risk`

## Findings & Remediations
1. **Audit history unusable when log contains corrupt entries.** Any malformed JSON or invalid timestamp caused `get_audit_history` to raise and return an empty list, blocking governance review dashboards. Added defensive parsing, validation, and filtering so bad lines are skipped instead of aborting the query. New regression tests cover both filtered and non-filtered lookups.
2. **Governance metrics polluted by invalid telemetry.** `get_audit_statistics` previously counted malformed entries and would crash while building the timeline. Statistics now ignore non-object rows and entries missing valid ISO timestamps, ensuring totals and date ranges reflect only trustworthy records.
3. **Risk position book vulnerable to race conditions.** Concurrent calls to `validate_position`, `add_position`, or `update_position_value` mutated `self.positions` without coordination, risking lost updates and inconsistent sector limits in async runtimes. Introduced a re-entrant lock around all position book mutations and readers, added locked helpers, and reused them throughout the risk manager.
4. **Audit trail lacked tamper evidence.** Added hash-chain integrity metadata, export helpers, and a verification routine so governance packs can prove continuity of the JSONL ledger even if corruption occurs mid-file. Integrity enforcement is optional but enabled by default for production deployments.

## Testing
- `pytest tests/governance/test_audit_logger.py`
- `pytest tests/risk/test_risk_manager_impl_additional.py`

## Follow-ups
- Consider lightweight rotation/compaction for the audit log to prevent unbounded growth.
- Extend concurrency review to other governance storage layers (e.g., SQLite registry) for parity with the risk manager safeguards.
