# EMP Sprint Plan: Security & Quality Improvements

**Objective:** Close all enterprise-readiness gaps in EMP by implementing production-grade authentication, encryption, data validation, access control, secret rotation, and observability. Tasks are designed for execution with AI co-development.

---

## 1. User & Process Authentication

- [ ] Integrate OAuth2 or token-based authentication for APIs and dashboards  
- [ ] Add authentication middleware to protect endpoints  
- [ ] Create basic user role storage (in-memory or database)  
- [ ] Secure API access via token validation  
- [ ] Document how to acquire and use authentication tokens  

---

## 2. Encryption at Rest & In Transit

- [ ] Enforce TLS on all API/web services  
- [ ] Support HTTPS for development (e.g. self-signed certificates)  
- [ ] Add warnings if production runs without TLS  
- [ ] Store DuckDB files on encrypted volume or encrypt sensitive fields  
- [ ] Ensure logs/configs do not store plaintext secrets  
- [ ] Document encryption setup and deployment practices  

---

## 3. Real-World Data Validation & Quality Checks

- [ ] Build validation layer for incoming data streams  
- [ ] Define rules for required fields, value ranges, and data types  
- [ ] Implement anomaly/outlier detection (e.g. IQR, z-score)  
- [ ] Log validation failures with contextual details  
- [ ] Create unit tests for invalid data scenarios  
- [ ] Document validation logic and how to handle failures  

---

## 4. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Scaffolding

- [ ] Define initial roles (e.g. admin, reader, ingest_process)  
- [ ] Add role checks (decorators or guards) to protected routes  
- [x] Embed role information in auth tokens (e.g. JWT claims)  
- [ ] Apply RBAC to at least a few critical endpoints  
- [x] Document how RBAC works and how to extend it  

---

## 5. Secrets Rotation & Credential Expiry

- [ ] Build a script to check age of API keys and secrets  
- [ ] Log or alert if secrets exceed defined age thresholds  
- [ ] (Optional) Integrate with a secrets manager (e.g. AWS Secrets Manager, Vault)  
- [x] Set expiration time on user tokens (e.g. JWT expiry)  
- [ ] Document secret rotation practices and automation goals  

---

## 6. Observability & Security Monitoring

- [ ] Log all auth events, RBAC rejections, and validation failures  
- [x] Track key metrics (e.g. failed logins, rejected records per hour)  
- [ ] Expose metrics endpoint or write logs compatible with monitoring stack  
- [ ] Add config options for log level, output format (e.g. JSON), and destination  
- [ ] Ensure sensitive data is excluded or masked in logs  
- [ ] Document observability practices and alerting roadmap
