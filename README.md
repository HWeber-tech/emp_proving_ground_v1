## Overview

The EMP Proving Ground is an **advanced algorithmic trading framework** that combines evolutionary intelligence, multi-dimensional market perception, and institutional-grade risk management. The system is designed to evolve trading strategies through genetic algorithms while maintaining rigorous governance and operational controls.

**Current Status:** Development Framework with Substantial Implementations

The codebase represents a sophisticated architecture with many functional subsystems, but it is **not yet production-ready** for live trading. This README provides an honest assessment of what works, what's in progress, and what remains to be built.

### Project Statistics

- **Source Code:** 662 Python files, 202,140 lines
- **Test Coverage:** 542 test files, 95,958 lines
- **Architecture:** 36 major subsystems across 5 layers
- **Documentation:** 209 markdown files, comprehensive technical specifications

---

## Philosophy

The EMP system embodies three core principles:

1. **Antifragile Design** - Systems that gain strength from volatility and market stress, not just survive them
2. **Evolutionary Intelligence** - Strategies that evolve through genetic algorithms and continuous learning
3. **Multi-Dimensional Perception** - Market analysis across fundamental (WHY), institutional (HOW), technical (WHAT), temporal (WHEN), and anomaly dimensions

The project follows a **truth-first development philosophy**: all claims are backed by verifiable code, realistic timelines acknowledge actual constraints, and documentation honestly reflects implementation status.

---

## Architecture

The system follows a five-layer architecture with clear separation of concerns:

### ⚠️ Partially Implemented

These components have **architectural foundations** but require additional work:

#### 1. Evolutionary Intelligence (`src/evolution/`, `src/genome/`)
- **What works**: Genome representation, population management, basic genetic operators
- **Progress**: A new `EvolutionScheduler` ingests live PnL, drawdown, and latency telemetry, enforcing cooldown windows and percentile triggers before launching optimisation cycles so evolution runs react deterministically to production performance.【F:src/evolution/engine/scheduler.py†L1-L200】
- **What's missing**: Sophisticated fitness functions, full strategy evolution (currently only parameter tuning)
- **Status**: Framework complete; needs enhanced evolution logic

#### 2. Sensory Cortex (`src/sensory/`)
- **What works**: RealSensoryOrgan integration, technical indicators, order book analytics framework, plus an `InstrumentTranslator` service that normalises multi-venue aliases (Bloomberg, Reuters, cTrader, CME, NASDAQ) into the universal instrument model using configurable mappings.【F:src/sensory/services/instrument_translator.py†L1-L200】【F:config/system/instrument_aliases.json†L1-L37】
- **What's missing**: Real-time data feeds, comprehensive fundamental data, live institutional footprint tracking
- **Status**: Architecture solid; limited by data source availability

#### 3. Strategy Library (`src/trading/strategies/`)
- **What works**: Strategy protocol, signal generation framework, ICT microstructure features
- **What's missing**: Comprehensive library of tested strategies
- **Status**: Framework exists; needs strategy development – the new
  `VolatilityTradingStrategy` blends implied vs realised volatility spreads with
  gamma scalping and microstructure alignment signals under regression coverage.

#### 4. Operations (`src/operations/`)
- **What works**: ObservabilityDashboard, PaperRunGuardian, incident playbook CLI, and an incident-response chaos simulation harness that stages responder outages, runbook corruption, stale metrics, and surge drills while exporting markdown/JSON evidence for readiness reviews.【F:src/operations/incident_simulation.py†L1-L200】

- **Progress**: Kibana dashboard deployment CLI automates Saved Objects imports,
  emits human-readable saved object summaries, and supports API key/basic auth
  plus partial-failure handling for observability refreshes.
- **Status**: Governance tooling complete; production infrastructure pending

#### 5. Fundamental Data Provider Strategy (`docs/research/fundamental_data_provider_selection.md`)
- **What works**: Comparative analysis across FMP, Polygon.io, Intrinio, Alpha Vantage, and Quandl with weighted scoring
- **What's missing**: Implementing ingestion adapters, storage schema extensions, and governance policies for the recommended vendors
- **Status**: Research complete; awaiting engineering execution

## What's Missing

### ❌ Critical Gaps

These features are **required for production deployment** but not yet implemented:

1. **Real-Time Data Streaming**
   - Broker/WebSocket adapters and live feed supervision still pending. A hardened `WebSocketClient` with reconnect, heartbeat, and rate-limited send support now ships under `data_foundation/streaming`, but venue-specific adapters are not yet wired into ingest pipelines.【F:src/data_foundation/streaming/websocket_client.py†L1-L200】
   - Streaming cache now retains tick windows with Redis compatibility but has no upstream connectors yet
   - **Impact**: Cannot trade live markets without real-time data

2. **LOBSTER Dataset Integration**
   - Parser exists for messages and order book snapshots, yet no reconstruction engine or sensory cortex wiring
   - Framework exists (`order_book_analytics.py`) but upstream ingestion still incomplete
   - **Impact**: Cannot train on high-frequency order book data as intended

3. **Comprehensive Backtesting**
   - No historical replay engine
   - Paper trading exists but not systematic backtest framework
   - **Impact**: Cannot validate strategies before live deployment

4. **Automated ML Training Pipeline**
   - Learning components exist but no automated retraining
   - Manual intervention required for model updates
   - **Impact**: Cannot achieve fully autonomous operation

5. **OpenBloomberg / Alternative Data**
   - Vendor evaluation complete, but no Bloomberg-equivalent or fundamental adapters implemented
   - Fundamental provider analysis recommends FMP/Polygon/Intrinio mix, yet ingestion remains to be built
   - **Impact**: WHY dimension is architecturally present but data-limited

### 🔧 Enhancement Opportunities

These features would **improve functionality** but are not blocking:

1. **Instrument Translation Protocol**
   - Current: Basic symbol mapping
   - Needed: Universal instrument representation across asset classes

2. **Advanced Evolutionary Algorithms**
   - Current: Parameter tuning
   - Needed: Full strategy discovery and multi-objective optimization

3. **Mamba-3 Backbone**
   - Current: Named stub with identity forward pass
   - Needed: Full state-space model implementation

4. **Regulatory Reporting**
   - Current: Audit trails and decision diary
   - Needed: Formatted compliance reports
