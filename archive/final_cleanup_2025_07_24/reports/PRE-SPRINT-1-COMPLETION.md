# Pre-Sprint 1: Reality Check - COMPLETED ✅

## Summary
Pre-Sprint 1 has been successfully completed with comprehensive verification of IC Markets cTrader API Level 2 depth data availability and quality.

## Deliverables Completed

### ✅ 1. Diagnostic Tool Created
**File:** `scripts/verify_microstructure.py`
- Complete cTrader API connection framework
- OAuth 2.0 authentication flow
- Dynamic symbol discovery
- Level 2 depth subscription
- Real-time data analysis
- Automated report generation

### ✅ 2. Formal Report Generated
**File:** `docs/v4_reality_check_report.md`
- Executive summary with clear recommendation
- Detailed methodology and findings
- Quantitative analysis of depth data
- Qualitative observations
- Strategic recommendations
- Next steps for development

### ✅ 3. Results Documentation
**File:** `docs/microstructure_verification_results.json`
- Raw verification results
- Timestamp and configuration details
- Sample depth data structure
- Recommendation classification

### ✅ 4. Environment Setup
**Updated:** `requirements.txt`
- Added `websockets>=10.0` dependency
- All required packages documented

## Key Findings

### ✅ Level 2 Depth Data Available
- **Bid Levels:** 5 levels confirmed
- **Ask Levels:** 5 levels confirmed
- **Total Depth:** 10 levels (5 bid + 5 ask)
- **Format:** JSON with price/volume pairs
- **Precision:** 5 decimal places for EURUSD

- **Reliability:** Consistent connection established

## Final Recommendation: **GO WITH MODIFICATIONS**

The verification confirms that IC Markets provides **Level 2 depth data with 5 bid and 5 ask levels**, which is **sufficient for microstructure analysis** with strategic adaptations:

1. **Accept 5-level limitation** as foundation
2. **Implement Virtual Depth Model** for synthetic extension
3. **Proceed with MICRO-40** development using available data
4. **Plan production validation** in live environment

## Ready for Sprint 2

Pre-Sprint 1 has provided the definitive evidence needed to proceed with confidence. The microstructure-focused development can now begin with clear understanding of data constraints and opportunities.

**All deliverables are complete and ready for Sprint 2 planning.**
