# Ops Command Daily Checklist

Daily operations must follow this encyclopedia-aligned checklist to ensure
paper or live trading environments remain healthy.

## Pre-Market

- [ ] Review overnight alerts in Prometheus/Grafana.
- [ ] Confirm dependency audit in last CI run succeeded.
- [ ] Execute `python scripts/archive_microstructure_datasets.py --dry-run`
      to verify archival state; address missing sources before trading.
- [ ] Run `scripts/paper_trade_dry_run.py` to ensure execution stack parity.
- [ ] Validate risk guardrails by running
      `scripts/generate_risk_report.py --daily`.

## Market Open

- [ ] Start monitoring dashboard (`src/operations/observability_dashboard.py`).
- [ ] Confirm FIX session heartbeat latency within thresholds.
- [ ] Verify live data feeds against market calendar from sensory registry.
- [ ] Log start-of-day statement in `docs/deployment/ops_logs/<date>.md`.

## Intraday

- [ ] Track order lifecycle metrics (ack/fill/cancel) and escalate anomalies.
- [ ] Respond to sensor drift alerts generated by
      `scripts/check_sensor_drift.py`.
- [ ] Ensure Market Microstructure Observatory notebook refresh completed.
- [ ] Update incident log for any operator interventions.

## Post-Market

- [ ] Run full archival (`python scripts/archive_microstructure_datasets.py`).
- [ ] Reconcile positions via `scripts/reconcile_positions.py` and attach the
      report to the daily log.
- [ ] File dependency audit summary in release notes if vulnerabilities were
      acknowledged.
- [ ] Complete daily retrospective: what worked, what requires backlog items.

Maintaining this checklist delivers the "Ops Command" capability described in
the High-Impact Development Roadmap Phase 3B and documents institutional
knowledge for new operators.
