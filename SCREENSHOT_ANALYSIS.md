## CRITICAL CONFIGURATION DISCREPANCY IDENTIFIED

### Screenshot Configuration vs. Our Implementation

**Price Connection (from screenshot):**
```
Host name: demo-uk-eqx-01.p.c-trader.com
Port: 5211 (SSL), 5201 (Plain text)
SenderCompID: demo.icmarkets.9533708
TargetCompID: cServer
SenderSubID: QUOTE
```

**Trade Connection (from screenshot):**
```
Host name: demo-uk-eqx-01.p.c-trader.com
Port: 5212 (SSL), 5202 (Plain text)
SenderCompID: demo.icmarkets.9533708
TargetCompID: cServer
SenderSubID: TRADE
```

### Our Current Implementation
```
Host: h51.p.ctrader.com
Port: 5201 (both connections)
```

## MAJOR FINDING: CONFIGURATION MISMATCH

### The Issue
**We corrected to the wrong host based on documentation, but the actual cTrader interface shows different endpoints:**

- **Documentation suggested:** h51.p.ctrader.com
- **Actual cTrader interface shows:** demo-uk-eqx-01.p.c-trader.com
- **Our tests with h51.p.ctrader.com:** Authentication works but limited functionality
- **Original attempts with demo-uk-eqx-01.p.c-trader.com:** Had authentication issues due to TargetSubID problems

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **We fixed the TargetSubID issue** (TRADE â†’ QUOTE for trade connection)
2. **But we also changed the host** based on documentation
3. **The screenshot shows the original host was correct** for this specific account
4. **We need to combine both fixes:** correct host + correct TargetSubID

## CORRECT CONFIGURATION BASED ON SCREENSHOT

### Price Connection (Corrected)
```
Host: demo-uk-eqx-01.p.c-trader.com
Port: 5211 (SSL) or 5201 (Plain text)
SenderCompID: demo.icmarkets.9533708
TargetCompID: cServer
SenderSubID: QUOTE
TargetSubID: QUOTE  # This was our key fix
```

### Trade Connection (Corrected)
```
Host: demo-uk-eqx-01.p.c-trader.com
Port: 5212 (SSL) or 5202 (Plain text)
SenderCompID: demo.icmarkets.9533708
TargetCompID: cServer
SenderSubID: TRADE
TargetSubID: QUOTE  # This was our key fix (not TRADE as shown)
```

## WHY CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION PARTIALLY WORKS

### h51.p.ctrader.com Analysis
- **Authentication:** Works (both sessions authenticate)
- **Market Data:** Works for Symbol 1 (EURUSD)
- **Order Execution:** Fails (no ExecutionReport)
- **Multi-Symbol:** Limited (Symbol 2+ rejected)

### Possible Explanation
- **h51.p.ctrader.com:** Generic/shared IC Markets endpoint
- **demo-uk-eqx-01.p.c-trader.com:** Account-specific endpoint with full permissions
- **Trading permissions:** May be tied to specific endpoints
- **Symbol access:** May be restricted on generic endpoints

---

## HYPOTHESIS FOR ORDER EXECUTION FAILURE

### Current Issue
- Orders sent to h51.p.ctrader.com are accepted but not executed
- Market data works but trading functionality is limited
- Account-specific features may require account-specific endpoint

### Solution Path
1. **Revert to original host:** demo-uk-eqx-01.p.c-trader.com
2. **Keep TargetSubID fix:** QUOTE for both connections
3. **Use correct ports:** 5211 for price, 5212 for trade
4. **Test full functionality:** Market data + order execution

---

## IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

### Step 1: Update Configuration
- Host: demo-uk-eqx-01.p.c-trader.com (revert to screenshot)
- Ports: 5211 (price), 5212 (trade) (revert to screenshot)
- TargetSubID: QUOTE for both (keep our fix)

### Step 2: Test Complete Functionality
- Authentication on both sessions
- Market data for multiple symbols
- Order placement with ExecutionReport confirmation

### Step 3: Validate Trading
- Confirm orders appear in account
- Verify ExecutionReport processing
- Test with different symbols and order types

---

## EXPECTED OUTCOME

### Combining Both Fixes
- **Original host (from screenshot):** Account-specific permissions
- **TargetSubID fix (our discovery):** Proper session configuration
- **Result:** Full trading functionality with proper execution

### Why This Should Work
1. **Account-specific endpoint:** Full permissions for trading
2. **Correct session configuration:** Proper message routing
3. **Confirmed trading permissions:** IC Markets verified account is enabled
4. **Proven protocol implementation:** Our FIX message format works

---

## CONCLUSION

**Root Cause:** We fixed the TargetSubID issue but overcorrected by changing the host. The screenshot shows we need the original account-specific host with our TargetSubID fix.

**Solution:** Combine the account-specific endpoint (demo-uk-eqx-01.p.c-trader.com) with our TargetSubID correction (QUOTE for both sessions).

**Expected Result:** Full FIX API functionality including actual order execution and multi-symbol support.
