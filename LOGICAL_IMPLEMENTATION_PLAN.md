## üèóÔ∏è IMPLEMENTATION PHILOSOPHY

### **Foundation-First Approach**
This implementation plan follows a **foundation-first methodology** where each layer builds upon verified, working components. No advancement to higher-level features occurs until the foundational layer is completely functional and tested.
