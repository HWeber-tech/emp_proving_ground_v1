# Alignment briefs

This directory houses the context packs that translate the claims in `EMP_ENCYCLOPEDIA_v2.3_CANONICAL.md` into actionable modernization plans. Each brief should:

- Quote the relevant concept promises so discovery and execution inherit the same narrative.
- Capture the current implementation snapshot with links to code, validation, and telemetry artefacts.
- Define the epics, acceptance criteria, and validation hooks that close the gap.

See [`docs/roadmap.md`](../../roadmap.md) for the prioritized gap areas and delivery checkpoints that these briefs unlock.

Pull request and issue templates under [`.github/`](../../../.github) embed these briefs directly into the review workflow so contributors quote concept excerpts, evidence the current gap, and attach validation telemetry for every change.

## Published briefs

- [Institutional data backbone](institutional_data_backbone.md) – professional ingest, caching, and streaming runway.
- [Sensory cortex & anomaly telemetry](sensory_cortex.md) – HOW/WHEN/WHY/ANOMALY organs, drift telemetry, and runtime summaries.
- [Evolution engine & catalogue seeding](evolution_engine.md) – institutional genome catalogue, feature flags, and validation hooks for adaptive populations.
- [Institutional risk, execution & compliance telemetry](institutional_risk_compliance.md) – risk policy, execution readiness, compliance monitors, and audit journaling.
- [Operational readiness & resilience telemetry](operational_readiness.md) – backup drills, incident response, security posture, and professional readiness aggregates.
- [Quality & observability guardrails](quality_observability.md) – regression coverage, AlphaTrade decision narration, and drift/throttle observability hygiene across the platform.【F:docs/context/alignment_briefs/quality_observability.md†L26-L220】
