# Governance & Risk Code Audit – Phase II Completion Refresh (2025-03-20)

## Scope
- Re-ran a lightweight audit of the RiskGateway stop-loss handling pathways with a
  focus on `stop_loss_pips` conversions and enforcement of configured safety
  floors.
- Sampled the existing regression matrix for gaps around pip-based stop-loss
  inputs and portfolio equity prerequisites that guard the position-sizing loop.

## Quick Fixes
- Added targeted regression coverage that exercises the `stop_loss_pips` branch
  in `RiskGateway._extract_stop_loss_pct`, verifying that pip distances are
  correctly converted into percentage risk before reaching the fast-weight
  position sizer.  The test asserts the derived percentage, checks that the
  position sizer was invoked, and confirms the risk assessment diary records the
  check for auditability. 【F:tests/current/test_risk_gateway_validation.py†L210-L244】
- Added a complementary test that drives a pip-distance below the configured
  floor to ensure the enforcement logic clamps to the minimum risk threshold
  rather than propagating an unsafe near-zero value. 【F:tests/current/test_risk_gateway_validation.py†L247-L276】

## Findings & Follow-ups
- **Coverage gap resolved:** Prior audit runs lacked direct assertions around the
  pip-distance pathway, leaving the conversion logic vulnerable to regression.
  The new tests raise branch coverage for the stop-loss helpers and provide
  deterministic evidence that risk diaries surface the sizing check outcome.
- **Operational signal quality:** The conversion depends on an upstream
  `pip_value` in the portfolio state.  During review we noted that thin venues
  may omit this metric; recommend extending the ingestion layer to emit a
  telemetry warning when `pip_value` is missing so operators can diagnose data
  feed issues before live deployment.

## Validation
- `pytest tests/current/test_risk_gateway_validation.py::test_risk_gateway_converts_stop_loss_pips_for_position_sizer`
- `pytest tests/current/test_risk_gateway_validation.py::test_risk_gateway_stop_loss_pips_respects_floor`
